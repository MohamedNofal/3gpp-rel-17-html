General description of RRC_IDLE state and RRC_INACTIVE state</h1>
<h2 id="overview">4.1 Overview</h2>
<p>The RRC_IDLE state and RRC_INACTIVE state tasks can be subdivided
into three processes:</p>
<p>- PLMN selection (for UE not operating in SNPN access mode) or SNPN
selection (for UE operating in SNPN access mode);</p>
<p>- Cell selection and reselection;</p>
<p>- Location registration and RNA update.</p>
<p>PLMN selection, SNPN selection, cell reselection procedures, and
location registration are common for both RRC_IDLE state and
RRC_INACTIVE state. RNA update is only applicable for RRC_INACTIVE
state. When UE selects a new PLMN or SNPN, UE transitions from
RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE, as specified in TS 24.501 [14].</p>
<p>When a UE is switched on, a public land mobile network (PLMN) or a
SNPN is selected by NAS. For the selected PLMN/SNPN, associated RAT(s)
may be set, as specified in TS 23.122 [9]. The NAS shall provide a list
of equivalent PLMNs, if available, that the AS shall use for cell
selection and cell reselection.</p>
<p>With cell selection, the UE searches for a suitable cell of the
selected PLMN or selected SNPN, chooses that cell to provide available
services, and monitors its control channel. This procedure is defined as
"camping on the cell".</p>
<p>The UE shall, if necessary, then register its presence, by means of a
NAS registration procedure, in the tracking area of the chosen cell. As
an outcome of a successful Location Registration, the selected PLMN/SNPN
then becomes the registered PLMN/SNPN, as specified in TS 23.122
[9].</p>
<p>If the UE finds a more suitable cell, according to the cell
reselection criteria, it reselects onto that cell and camps on it. If
the new cell does not belong to at least one tracking area to which the
UE is registered, location registration is performed. In RRC_INACTIVE
state, if the new cell does not belong to the configured RNA, an RNA
update procedure is performed.</p>
<p>If necessary, the UE shall search for higher priority PLMNs at
regular time intervals as described in TS 23.122 [9] and search for a
suitable cell if another PLMN has been selected by NAS.</p>
<p>For UE not operating in SNPN access mode, search of available CAGs
may be triggered by NAS to support manual CAG selection. The AS shall
report available CAG-ID(s) together with their HRNN (if broadcast) and
PLMN(s) to the NAS.</p>
<p>NAS may also provide the network slice(s) and Network Slice AS Group
(NSAG) information, which contains NSAG(s), their applicable TA(s) if
present and their priorities, to be considered by the UE during cell
reselection (as specified in TS 23.501 [10], TS 24.501 [14]).</p>
<p>If the UE loses coverage of the registered PLMN/SNPN, either a new
PLMN/SNPN is selected automatically (automatic mode), or an indication
of available PLMNs/SNPNs is given to the user so that a manual selection
can be performed (manual mode). As part of manual SNPN selection, the AS
shall report available SNPN identifiers together with their HRNN (if
broadcast) to the NAS.</p>
<p>Registration is not performed by UEs only capable of services that
need no registration.</p>
<p>The UE may perform NR sidelink communication and/or V2X sidelink
communication while in-coverage or out-of-coverage for sidelink, as
specified in clause 8.</p>
<p>The U2N Remote UE, the U2N Relay UE, or both may perform sidelink
discovery transmissions while in-coverage for the purpose of sidelink
relay operations, as specified in clause 8. In addition, the U2N Remote
UE can also perform sidelink discovery transmissions while
out-of-coverage for the purpose of sidelink relay operations.</p>
<p>An L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE may perform all
the relevant procedures (e.g., acquiring system information and paging
message) via the L2 U2N Relay UE. An L2 U2N Remote UE may choose not to
perform any procedures related to cell selection and reselection.</p>
<p>The UE may perform NR sidelink discovery transmissions while
in-coverage or out-of-coverage for the purpose of sidelink non-relay
operations, as specified in clause 8.</p>
<p>The purpose of camping on a cell in RRC_IDLE state and RRC_INACTIVE
state is as follows:</p>
<p>a) It enables the UE to receive system information from the PLMN or
the SNPN.</p>
<p>b) When registered and if the UE wishes to establish an RRC
connection or resume a suspended RRC connection, it can do this by
initially accessing the network on the control channel of the cell on
which it is camped.</p>
<p>c) If the network needs to send a message or deliver data to the
registered UE, it knows (in most cases) the set of tracking areas (in
RRC_IDLE state) or RNA (in RRC_INACTIVE state) in which the UE is
camped. It can then send a "paging" message for the UE on the control
channels of all the cells in the corresponding set of areas. The UE will
then receive the paging message and can respond.</p>
<p>d) It enables the UE to receive ETWS and CMAS notifications.</p>
<p>e) It enables the UE to receive MBS broadcast services.</p>
<p>When the UE is in RRC_IDLE state, upper layers may deactivate AS
layer when MICO mode is activated as specified in TS 24.501 [14]. When
MICO mode is activated, the AS configuration (e.g. priorities provided
by dedicated signalling) is kept and all running timers continue to run
but the UE need not perform any idle mode tasks. If a timer expires
while MICO mode is activated it is up to the UE implementation whether
it performs the corresponding action immediately or the latest when MICO
mode is deactivated. When MICO mode is deactivated, the UE shall perform
all idle mode tasks.</p>

<p>- if the UE in RRC_IDLE fulfils the conditions to support NR sidelink
communication/discovery or V2X sidelink communication in limited service
state as specified in TS23.287 [16] clause 5.7, the UE may perform NR
sidelink communication/discovery or V2X sidelink communication.</p>

<p>In the UE not operating in SNPN access mode, the AS shall report
available PLMNs and any associated CAG-IDs to the NAS on request from
the NAS or autonomously. In the UE operating in SNPN access mode, the AS
shall report available SNPNs to the NAS on request from the NAS or
autonomously.</p>
<p>During PLMN selection, based on the list of PLMN identities in
priority order, the particular PLMN may be selected either automatically
or manually. Each PLMN in the list of PLMN identities is identified by a
'PLMN identity'. In the system information on the broadcast channel, the
UE can receive one or multiple 'PLMN identity' in a given cell. The
result of the PLMN selection performed by NAS (see TS 23.122 [9]) is an
identifier of the selected PLMN.</p>
<p>During SNPN selection, based on the list of SNPN identities, the
particular SNPN may be selected either automatically or manually. Each
SNPN in the list of SNPN identities is identified by a 'SNPN identity'.
In the system information on the broadcast channel, the UE can receive
one or multiple 'SNPN identity' in a given cell and optionally may
receive associated HRNNs; the UE may also optionally receive indicators
for whether an SNPN allows access using credentials from a Credentials
Holder, whether an SNPN allows registration attempts from UEs that are
not explicitly configured to select this SNPN, and whether an SNPN
allows onboarding; the UE may also optionally receive a list of

carrier, the UE shall search for the strongest cell and read its system
information, in order to find out which PLMN(s) the cell belongs to and
any associated CAG(s). For operation with shared spectrum channel
access, the UE may also read the system information of multiple
strongest cell(s). If the UE can read one or several PLMN identities in
the strongest cell or the multiple strongest cell(s) in case of
operation with shared spectrum channel access, each found PLMN (see the
PLMN reading in TS 38.331 [3]) shall be reported to the NAS as a high
quality PLMN (but without the RSRP value) and any associated CAG-ID,
provided that the following high-quality criterion is fulfilled:</p>
<p>1. For an NR cell, the measured RSRP value shall be greater than or
equal to -110 dBm.</p>
<p>Found PLMNs that do not satisfy the high-quality criterion but for
which the UE has been able to read the PLMN identities are reported to
the NAS together with their corresponding RSRP values and any associated
CAG-ID. The quality measure reported by the UE to NAS shall be the same
for each PLMN found in one cell.</p>
<p>The search for PLMNs may be stopped on request from the NAS. The UE
may optimise PLMN search by using stored information e.g. frequencies
and optionally also information on cell parameters from previously
received measurement control information elements.</p>
<p>Once the UE has selected a PLMN, the cell selection procedure shall
be performed in order to select a suitable cell of that PLMN to camp
on.</p>
<p>To support manual CAG selection, the UE shall upon request by NAS
report available CAG-ID(s) together with their manual CAG selection
allowed indicator (if broadcast), HRNN (if broadcast) and PLMN(s) to the
NAS. If NAS has selected a CAG and provided this selection to AS, the UE

<h3 id="introduction">5.2.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>UE shall perform measurements for cell selection and reselection
purposes as specified in TS 38.133 [8].</p>
<p>When evaluating Srxlev and Squal of non-serving cells for reselection
evaluation purposes, the UE shall use parameters provided by the serving
cell and for the final check on cell selection criterion, the UE shall
use parameters provided by the target cell for cell reselection.</p>
<p>The NAS can control the RAT(s) in which the cell selection should be
performed, for instance by indicating RAT(s) associated with the
selected PLMN, and by maintaining a list of forbidden registration
area(s) and a list of equivalent PLMNs. The UE shall select a suitable
cell based on RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state measurements and cell
selection criteria.</p>
<p>In order to expedite the cell selection process, stored information
for several RATs, if available, may be used by the UE.</p>
<p>When camped on a cell, the UE shall regularly search for a better
cell according to the cell reselection criteria. If a better cell is
found, that cell is selected. The change of cell may imply a change of
RAT. Details on performance requirements for cell reselection can be
found in TS 38.133 [8].</p>
<p>The NAS is informed if the cell selection and reselection result in
changes in the received system information relevant for NAS.</p>
<p>For normal service, the UE shall camp on a suitable cell, monitor
control channel(s) of that cell so that the UE can:</p>
<p>- receive system information from the PLMN or SNPN; and</p>
<p>- receive registration area information from the PLMN or SNPN, e.g.,
tracking area information; and</p>
<p>- receive other AS and NAS Information; and</p>
<p>- if registered:</p>
<p>- receive paging and notification messages from the PLMN or SNPN;
and</p>
<p>- initiate transfer to Connected mode.</p>
<p>For cell selection in multi-beam operations, measurement quantity of
a cell is up to UE implementation.</p>
<p>For cell reselection in multi-beam operations, including inter-RAT
reselection from E-UTRA to NR, the measurement quantity of this cell is
derived amongst the beams corresponding to the same cell based on
SS/PBCH block as follows:</p>
<blockquote>

E-UTRA) is not configured in <em>SIB2/SIB4</em> (<em>SIB24</em> in

<p>- if <em>absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation</em>
(<em>threshRS-Index</em> in E-UTRA) is not configured in
<em>SIB2/SIB4</em> (<em>SIB24</em> in E-UTRA); or</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- if the highest beam measurement quantity value is below or equal to
<em>absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation</em> (<em>threshRS-Index</em> in

<p>- derive a cell measurement quantity as the highest beam measurement
quantity value, where each beam measurement quantity is described in TS

UE preserves priorities provided by dedicated signalling and
<em>deprioritisationReq</em> received in <em>RRCRelease</em> unless
specified otherwise. When the UE in camped normally state, has only
dedicated priorities other than for the current frequency, the UE shall
consider the current frequency to be the lowest priority frequency (i.e.
lower than any of the network configured values). When the HSDN capable
UE is in High-mobility state, the UE shall always consider the HSDN
cells to be the highest priority (i.e., higher than any other network
configured priorities). When the HSDN capable UE is not in High-mobility
state, the UE shall always consider HSDN cells to be the lowest priority
(i.e., lower than any other network configured priorities). If the UE is
configured to perform both NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink
communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing both NR
sidelink communication configuration and V2X sidelink communication
configuration to be the highest priority. If the UE is configured to
perform NR sidelink communication and not perform V2X communication, the
UE may consider the frequency providing NR sidelink communication
configuration to be the highest priority. If the UE is configured to
perform V2X sidelink communication and not perform NR sidelink
communication, the UE may consider the frequency providing V2X sidelink
communication configuration to be the highest priority.</p>
<p>NOTE 0a: The frequency only providing the anchor frequency
configuration should not be prioritized for V2X service during cell
reselection, as specified in TS 38.331[3].</p>
<p>NOTE 0b: When UE is configured to perform NR sidelink communication
or V2X sidelink communication performs cell reselection, it may consider
the frequencies providing the intra-carrier and inter-carrier
configuration have equal priority in cell reselection.</p>
<p>NOTE 0c: The prioritization among the frequencies which UE considers
to be the highest priority frequency is left to UE implementation unless
otherwise stated.</p>
<p>NOTE 0d: The UE is configured to perform V2X sidelink communication
or NR sidelink communication, if it has the capability and is authorized
for the corresponding sidelink operation.</p>
<p>NOTE 0e: When UE is configured to perform both NR sidelink
communication and V2X sidelink communication, but cannot find a
frequency which can provide both NR sidelink communication configuration
and V2X sidelink communication configuration, UE may consider the
frequency providing either NR sidelink communication configuration or
V2X sidelink communication configuration to be the highest priority.</p>
<p>NOTE 0f: Void.</p>
<p>The UE shall only perform cell reselection evaluation for NR
frequencies and inter-RAT frequencies that are given in system
information and for which the UE has a priority provided.</p>
<p>If the MBS broadcast capable UE is receiving or interested to receive
an MBS broadcast service(s) and can only receive this MBS broadcast
service(s) by camping on a frequency on which it is provided, the UE may
consider that frequency to be the highest priority during the MBS
broadcast session as specified in TS 38.300 [2] as long as the two
following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<p>1) SIB1 scheduling information of the cell reselected by the UE due
to frequency prioritization for MBS contains SIB20;</p>
<p>2) Either:</p>
<p>- One or more MBS FSAI(s) of that frequency is indicated in SIB21 of
the serving cell and the same MBS FSAI(s) is also indicated for this MBS
broadcast service in MBS User Service Description (USD) as specified in
TS 26.517 [20], or</p>
<p>- SIB21 is not provided in the serving cell and that frequency is
included in the USD of this service, or</p>
<p>- SIB21 is provided in the serving cell but does not provide the
frequency mapping for the concerned service, and that frequency is
included in the USD of this service.</p>
<p>NOTE 0g: It is up to UE implementation which frequency to select,
when the USD provides multiple frequencies for the service the UE is
interested in.</p>
<p>If the MBS broadcast capable UE is receiving or interested to receive
an MBS broadcast service, the UE may consider cell reselection candidate
frequencies at which it cannot receive the MBS broadcast service to be
of the lowest priority during the MBS broadcast session as specified in
TS 38.300 [2], as long as SIB1 scheduling information of the cell
contains SIB20 on the MBS frequency which the UE monitors and as long as
the condition 2) above is fulfilled for the serving cell.</p>
<p>NOTE 0h: Example scenarios in which such down-prioritisation may be
needed include the cases where camping is not possible for the UE on the
MBS broadcast frequency (e.g. the MBS broadcast frequency belongs to a
PLMN different from UE's registered PLMN) while the UE can receive the
MBS broadcast service when camped on another frequency than the MBS
broadcast frequency or current frequency.</p>
<p>NOTE 0i: The frequency prioritization for MBS broadcast, NR sidelink
communication, or V2X sidelink communication may override the
re-selection priorities for slice-based cell reselection.</p>
<p>In case UE receives <em>RRCRelease</em> with
<em>deprioritisationReq</em>, UE shall consider current frequency and
stored frequencies due to the previously received <em>RRCRelease</em>
with <em>deprioritisationReq</em> or all the frequencies of NR to be the
lowest priority frequency (i.e. lower than any of the network configured
values) while T325 is running irrespective of camped RAT. The UE shall
delete the stored deprioritisation request(s) when a PLMN selection or
SNPN selection is performed on request by NAS (TS 23.122 [9]).</p>
<p>NOTE 1: UE should search for a higher priority layer for cell
reselection as soon as possible after the change of priority. The
minimum related performance requirements specified in TS 38.133 [8] are
still applicable.</p>
<p>NOTE 1a: The UE does not consider MBS broadcast, NR sidelink
communication or V2X sidelink communication functionality to replace
cell reselection priorities caused by HSDN or
<em>deprioritisationReq</em> functionality.</p>
<p>The UE shall delete priorities provided by dedicated signalling
when:</p>
<p>- the UE enters a different RRC state; or</p>
<p>- the optional validity time of dedicated priorities (T320) expires;
or</p>
<p>- the UE receives an <em>RRCRelease</em> message with the field
<em>cellReselectionPriorities</em> absent; or</p>
<p>- a PLMN selection or SNPN selection is performed on request by NAS
(TS 23.122 [9]).</p>
<p>NOTE 2: Equal priorities between RATs are not supported.</p>
<p>The UE shall not consider any exclude-listed cells as candidate for
cell reselection.</p>
<p>The UE shall consider only the allow-listed cells, if configured, as
candidates for cell reselection.</p>
<p>The UE in RRC_IDLE state shall inherit the priorities provided by
dedicated signalling and the remaining validity time (i.e. T320 in NR
and E-UTRA), if configured, at inter-RAT cell (re)selection.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: The network may assign dedicated cell reselection priorities
for frequencies not configured by system information.</p>

<p>- NAS provided NSAG information, only for NSAG(s) associated with the
network slice(s) provided by NAS for cell reselection (see TS 23.501
[10], TS 24.501 [14]),</p>
<p>- <em>sliceInfoList</em> and/or <em>sliceInfoListDedicated</em> per
frequency with <em>nsag-CellReselectionPriority</em> per NSAG, if
provided in system information and/or dedicated signalling (see TS
38.331 [3]),</p>
<p>- <em>cellReselectionPriority</em> per frequency provided in system
information and/or dedicated signalling (see TS 38.331 [3]).</p>

if</p>
<p>- the nsag-ID and TA of the NSAG indicated for the NR frequency (see
TS 38.331[3]) are included in the NSAG information provided by NAS. If
<em>FreqPriorityListDedicatedSlicing</em> is configured, UE only

an NSAG if</p>
<p><em>-</em> the nsag-ID and TA of the NSAG indicated for the NR
frequency in dedicated signalling but not in <em>SIB16</em> (see TS
38.331 [3]) are included in the NSAG information provided by NAS; or</p>
<p><em>-</em> the nsag-ID and TA of the NSAG indicated for the NR
frequency in <em>SIB16</em> (see TS 38.331 [3]) are included in the NSAG
information provided by NAS; and</p>
<p>- the cell is either listed in the <em>sliceAllowedCellListNR</em>

the <em>sliceExcludedCellListNR</em> (if provided in the
<em>sliceInfoList</em>); or</p>
<p>- Neither <em>sliceAllowedCellListNR</em> nor
<em>sliceExcludedCellListNR</em> is configured in the

<p>The UE shall derive reselection priorities for slice-based cell
reselection according to the following rules:</p>
<p>- Frequencies that support at least one prioritized NSAG received
from NAS have higher reselection priority than frequencies that support
none of the NSAG(s) received from NAS.</p>
<p>- Frequencies that support at least one NSAG provided by NAS are
prioritised in the order of the NAS-provided priority for the NSAG with
highest priority supported on the frequency.</p>
<p>- Among the frequencies (one or multiple) that support the highest
prioritised NSAG(s) with the same NAS-provided priorities, the
frequencies are prioritized in the order of their highest
<em>nsag-CellReselectionPriority</em> given for these NSAG(s). If no
<em>nsag-CellReselectionPriority</em> is given for a NSAG at a
frequency, the lowest priority value is used (i.e, lower than any of the
network configured values for these frequencies).</p>
<p>- Frequencies that support none of the NSAG(s) provided by NAS are
prioritized in the order of their <em>cellReselectionPriority</em>.</p>
<p>For a UE performing slice-based cell reselection, if the highest
ranked cell or best cell in a frequency fulfils the inter- freqeuency
cell reselection criteria (see clause 5.2.4.5) based on reselection
priority for the frequency and NSAG derived according to this clause or
fulfils intra-frequency and equal priority inter-frequency cell
reselection criteria (see clause 5.2.4.6), but this cell does not
support the NSAG according to this clause:</p>
<p>- if this cell supports any other NSAG(s) according to this clause,

corresponding NR frequency);</p>
<p>- Otherwise, the UE shall re-derive a reselection priority for the
frequency as if none of the NSAG(s) provided by NAS is supported.</p>
<p>This re-derived reselection priority is used for a maximum of 300

<p>The NAS is informed if the cell selection and reselection results in
changes in the received NAS system information.</p>
<p>The UE shall monitor the Paging Occasions (POs) as described in
clause 7.1 to receive System Information change notifications in
RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE. The changes in the system information are
notified by the network using a Short Message as specified in TS 38.331
[3]. When the Short Message notifies system information changes, then
the UE shall acquire or re-acquire the concerned system information as
specified in TS 38.331 [3].</p>
<p>A L2 U2N Remote UE when in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE may not monitor
POs as described in clause 7.1 to receive Short Message when connected
with a U2N Relay UE, as specified in TS 38.331 [3].</p>
<p>A L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE does not receive Short

U2N Relay UE may forward to the L2 U2N Remote UE only Public Warning
System information (e.g., <em>SIB6</em>, <em>SIB7</em>, and
<em>SIB8</em>).</p>
<p>When system information changes, the L2 U2N Remote UE, when in
RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, relies on the U2N L2 Relay UE to acquire or

receive is started or ongoing by receiving the MCCH information, and
then receives a MTCH(s) configured using the Broadcast MRB establishment
procedure as specified in TS 38.331 [3] and using the DL-SCH reception
and MBS broadcast DRX procedure as specified in TS 38.321 [19].</p>
<p>UEs which have joined a multicast session(s) and are in
RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE state shall apply the reception of the paging

group notification as specified in clause 16.10.5.2 in TS 38.300
[2].</p>
<h1 id="paging">7 Paging</h1>
<h2 id="discontinuous-reception-for-paging">7.1 Discontinuous Reception
for paging</h2>
<p>The UE may use Discontinuous Reception (DRX) in RRC_IDLE and
RRC_INACTIVE state in order to reduce power consumption. The UE monitors
one paging occasion (PO) per DRX cycle. A PO is a set of PDCCH
monitoring occasions and can consist of multiple time slots (e.g.
subframe or OFDM symbol) where paging DCI can be sent (TS 38.213 [4]).
One Paging Frame (PF) is one Radio Frame and may contain one or multiple
PO(s) or starting point of a PO. A L2 U2N Relay UE monitors the paging
occasions of its PC5-RRC connected L2 U2N Remote UEs. In this case, the
DRX cycle and UE ID mentioned in this clause refer to those of the L2
U2N Remote UE.</p>
<p>In multi-beam operations, the UE assumes that the same paging message
and the same Short Message are repeated in all transmitted beams and
thus the selection of the beam(s) for the reception of the paging
message and Short Message is up to UE implementation. The paging message
is same for both RAN initiated paging and CN initiated paging.</p>
<p>The UE initiates RRC Connection Resume procedure upon receiving RAN
initiated paging. If the UE receives a CN initiated paging in
RRC_INACTIVE state, the UE moves to RRC_IDLE and informs NAS. However,
if a L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_INACTIVE state receives a CN initiated
paging for a L2 U2N Remote UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE does not move to
RRC_IDLE state.</p>
<p>NOTE 0a: The L2 U2N Remote UE does not need to monitor the PO in
order to receive the paging message.</p>
<p>NOTE 0b: While the SDT procedure is ongoing in RRC_INACTIVE state,
the UE monitors the PO in order to receive only the Short Message as
specified in TS 38.331 [3].</p>
<p>The PF and PO for paging are determined by the following
formulae:</p>
<p>SFN for the PF is determined by:</p>
<p>(SFN + PF_offset) mod T = (T div N)*(UE_ID mod N)</p>
<p>Index (i_s), indicating the index of the PO is determined by:</p>
<p>i_s = floor (UE_ID/N) mod Ns</p>
<p>The PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging are determined according to
<em>pagingSearchSpace</em> as specified in TS 38.213 [4] and
<em>firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO</em> and
<em>nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO</em> if configured as
specified in TS 38.331 [3]. When <em>SearchSpaceId</em> = 0 is
configured for <em>pagingSearchSpace</em>, the PDCCH monitoring
occasions for paging are same as for RMSI as defined in clause 13 in TS
38.213 [4].</p>
<p>When <em>SearchSpaceId</em> = 0 is configured for
<em>pagingSearchSpace</em>, Ns is either 1 or 2. For Ns = 1, there is
only one PO which starts from the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for
paging in the PF. For Ns = 2, PO is either in the first half frame (i_s
= 0) or the second half frame (i_s = 1) of the PF.</p>
<p>When <em>SearchSpaceId</em> other than 0 is configured for
<em>pagingSearchSpace,</em> the UE monitors the (i_s + 1)<sup>th</sup>
PO. A PO is a set of 'S*X ' consecutive PDCCH monitoring occasions where
'S' is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to
<em>ssb-PositionsInBurst</em> in <em>SIB1</em> and X is the
<em>nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO</em> if configured or is
equal to 1 otherwise. The [x*S+K]<sup>th</sup> PDCCH monitoring occasion
for paging in the PO corresponds to the K<sup>th</sup> transmitted SSB,
where x=0,1,…,X-1, K=1,2,…,S. The PDCCH monitoring occasions for paging
which do not overlap with UL symbols (determined according to
<em>tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon</em>) are sequentially numbered from
zero starting from the first PDCCH monitoring occasion for paging in the
PF. When <em>firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO</em> is present, the
starting PDCCH monitoring occasion number of (i_s + 1)<sup>th</sup> PO
is the (i_s + 1)<sup>th</sup> value of the
<em>firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO</em> parameter; otherwise, it is
equal to i_s * S*X. If X &gt; 1, when the UE detects a PDCCH
transmission addressed to P-RNTI within its PO, the UE is not required
to monitor the subsequent PDCCH monitoring occasions for this PO.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: A PO associated with a PF may start in the PF or after the
PF.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can span multiple
radio frames. When <em>SearchSpaceId</em> other than 0 is configured for
<em>paging-SearchSpace</em> the PDCCH monitoring occasions for a PO can
span multiple periods of the paging search space.</p>
<p>The following parameters are used for the calculation of PF and i_s
above:</p>
<p>T: DRX cycle of the UE.</p>
<p>If the UE does not operate in eDRX as defined in clause 7.4:</p>
<p>- T is determined by the shortest of the UE specific DRX value
configured by RRC (if any), the UE specific DRX value configured by
upper layers (if any), and a default DRX value broadcast in system
information. For L2 U2N Relay UE, T for a L2 U2N Remote UE is determined
by the shortest of the UE specific DRX value provided in PC5-RRC
signalling and a default DRX value broadcast in system information.</p>
<p>In RRC_IDLE state, if the UE operates in eDRX and eDRX is configured
by upper layers, i.e., T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>, according to clause

<p>- If T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub> is no longer than 1024 radio frames:</p>
<p>- T = T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>;</p>
<p>- else:</p>
<p>- During CN configured PTW, T is determined by the shortest of UE
specific DRX value, if configured by upper layers, and the default DRX
value broadcast in system information.</p>
<p>In RRC_INACTIVE state, if the UE operates in eDRX and eDRX is
configured by RRC, i.e., T<sub>eDRX, RAN</sub> (if any), and upper
layers, i.e., T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>, as defined in clause 7.4:</p>
<p>- If both T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub> and used T<sub>eDRX, RAN</sub> are no
longer than 1024 radio frames, T = min{T<sub>eDRX, RAN</sub>,
T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>}.</p>
<p>- If T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub> is no longer than 1024 radio frames and no

<p>- If T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub> is longer than 1024 radio frames:</p>
<p>- If T<sub>eDRX, RAN</sub> is not configured or used:</p>
<p>- During CN configured PTW, T is determined by the shortest of the UE
specific DRX value configured by RRC, the UE specific DRX value
configured by upper layers (if any), and a default DRX value broadcast
in system information. Outside the CN configured PTW, T is determined by
the UE specific DRX value configured by RRC;</p>
<p>- else if used T<sub>eDRX, RAN</sub> is no longer than 1024 radio
frames:</p>
<p>- During CN configured PTW, T is determined by the shortest of the UE

<p>Parameters <em>Ns</em>, <em>nAndPagingFrameOffset</em>,
<em>nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO</em>, and the length of

PF_offset are derived from the parameter <em>nAndPagingFrameOffset</em>
as defined in TS 38.331 [3]. The parameter
<em>firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO</em> is signalled in <em>SIB1</em>
for paging in the BWP configured by <em>initialDownlinkBWP</em>. For

<p>If the UE has no 5G-S-TMSI, for instance when the UE has not yet
registered onto the network, the UE shall use as default identity UE_ID

<p>5G-S-TMSI is a 48 bit long bit string as defined in TS 23.501 [10].
5G-S-TMSI shall in the formulae above be interpreted as a binary number
where the left most bit represents the most significant bit.</p>
<p>In RRC_INACTIVE state, if the UE supports
<em>inactiveStatePO-Determination</em> and the network broadcasts
<em>ranPagingInIdlePO</em> with value "true", the UE shall use the same
i_s as for RRC_IDLE state. Otherwise, the UE determines the i_s based on
the parameters and formula above.</p>
<p>In RRC_INACTIVE state, if used eDRX value configured by upper layers
is no longer than 1024 radio frames, the UE shall use the same i_s as
for RRC_IDLE state.</p>
<p>In RRC_INACTIVE state, if used eDRX value configured by upper layers
is longer than 1024 radio frames, during CN PTW, the UE shall use the

<h2 id="paging-early-indication">7.2 Paging Early Indication</h2>
<h3 id="paging-early-indication-reception">7.2.1 Paging Early Indication
reception</h3>
<p>The UE may use Paging Early Indication (PEI) in RRC_IDLE and
RRC_INACTIVE states in order to reduce power consumption. If PEI
configuration is provided in system information, the UE in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE state supporting PEI (except for the UEs expecting MBS
group notification) can monitor PEI using PEI parameters in system
information according to the procedure described below.</p>
<p>If <em>lastUsedCellOnly</em> is configured in system information of a
cell, the UE monitors PEI in this cell only if the UE most recently
received <em>RRCRelease</em> without <em>noLastCellUpdate</em> in this
cell. Otherwise (i.e., if <em>lastUsedCellOnly</em> is not configured in
system information of a cell), the UE monitors PEI in the camped
cell.</p>
<p>The UE monitors one PEI occasion per DRX cycle. A PEI occasion
(PEI-O) is a set of PDCCH monitoring occasions (MOs) and can consist of
multiple time slots (e.g. subframes or OFDM symbols) where PEI can be
sent (TS 38.213 [4]). In multi-beam operations, the UE assumes that the
same PEI is repeated in all transmitted beams and thus the selection of
the beam(s) for the reception of the PEI is up to UE implementation.</p>
<p>The time location of PEI-O for UE's PO is determined by a reference
point and an offset:</p>
<p>- The reference point is the start of a reference frame determined by
a frame-level offset from the start of the first PF of the PF(s)
associated with the PEI-O, provided by <em>pei-FrameOffset</em> in
SIB1;</p>
<p>- The offset is a symbol-level offset from the reference point to the
start of the first PDCCH MO of this PEI-O, provided by
<em>firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O</em> in SIB1.</p>
<p>If one PEI-O is associated with POs of two PFs, the two PFs are
consecutive PFs calculated by the parameters <em>PF_offset</em>,
<em>T</em>, <em>Ns</em>, and <em>N</em>. The first PF of the PFs
associated with the PEI-O is provided by (SFN for PF) - floor
(<em>i<sub>PO</sub></em>/<em>Ns</em>)*<em>T</em>/<em>N</em>, where SFN
for PF is determined in clause 7.1, <em>i<sub>PO</sub></em> is defined
in clause 10.4a in TS 38.213[4], <em>T</em>, <em>Ns</em>, and <em>N</em>
are determined in clause 7.1.</p>
<p>The PDCCH MOs for PEI are determined as specified in TS 38.213 [4]
according to <em>pei-SearchSpace</em>, <em>pei-FrameOffset</em>,
<em>firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O</em> and
<em>nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO</em> if configured as
specified in TS 38.331 [3]. When <em>SearchSpaceId</em> = 0 is
configured for <em>pei-SearchSpace</em>, the PDCCH MOs for PEI are same
as for RMSI as defined in clause 13 in TS 38.213 [4]. UE determines
first PDCCH MO for PEI-O based on <em>pei-FrameOffset</em> and
<em>firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O</em>, as for the case with
<em>SearchSpaceId</em> &gt; 0 configured.</p>
<p>When <em>SearchSpaceId</em> = 0 is configured for
<em>pei-SearchSpace</em>, the UE monitors the PEI-O according to
<em>searchSpaceZero</em>. When <em>SearchSpaceId</em> other than 0 is
configured for <em>pei-SearchSpace,</em> the UE monitors the PEI-O
according to the search space with the configured
<em>SearchSpaceId</em>.</p>
<p>A PEI occasion is a set of 'S*X' consecutive PDCCH MOs, where 'S' is
the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to
<em>ssb-PositionsInBurst</em> in <em>SIB1</em>, and X is the
<em>nrofPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionPerSSB-InPO</em> if configured or is
equal to 1 otherwise. The [x*S+K]<sup>th</sup> PDCCH MO for PEI in the
PEI-O corresponds to the K<sup>th</sup> transmitted SSB, where
x=0,1,…,X-1, K=1,2,…,S. The PDCCH MOs for PEI which do not overlap with
UL symbols (determined according to
<em>tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon</em>) are sequentially numbered from
zero starting from the first PDCCH MO for PEI in the PEI-O. When the UE
detects a PEI within its PEI-O, the UE is not required to monitor the
subsequent MO(s) associated with the same PEI-O.</p>
<p>If the UE detects PEI and the PEI indicates the subgroup the UE
belongs to monitor its associated PO, as specified in clause 10.4a in TS
38.213 [4], the UE monitors the associated PO as specified in clause
7.1. If the UE does not detect PEI on the monitored PEI occasion or the
PEI does not indicate the subgroup the UE belongs to monitor its
associated PO, as specified in clause 10.4a in TS 38.213 [4], the UE is
not required to monitor the associated PO as specified in clause
7.1.</p>
<p>If the UE is unable to monitor the PEI occasion (i.e. all valid PDCCH
MO for PEI) corresponding to its PO, e.g. during cell re-selection, the
UE monitors the associated PO according to clause 7.1.</p>
<p>In RRC_INACTIVE state, when the UE uses the same i­_s as for RRC_IDLE
state as specified in clause 7.1, the UE shall use the same
<em>i<sub>PO</sub></em> as for RRC_IDLE state. Otherwise, the UE
determines the <em>i<sub>PO</sub></em> based on the formula defined in
clause 10.4a in TS 38.213 [4].</p>
<h2 id="subgrouping">7.3 Subgrouping</h2>
<h3 id="general-2">7.3.0 General</h3>
<p>If PEI and subgrouping are configured, UEs monitoring the same PO can
be divided into one or more subgroups. With subgrouping, the UE monitors
the associated PO if the corresponding bit for subgroup the UE belongs
to is indicated as 1 by PEI corresponding to its PO, as specified in
clause 10.4a in TS 38.213 [4].</p>
<p>The following parameters are used for the determination of subgroup
ID:</p>
<p>- <em>subgroupsNumPerPO</em>: total number of subgroups for both CN
assigned subgrouping (if any) and UE_ID based subgrouping (if any) in a
PO, which is broadcasted in system information;</p>
<p>- <em>subgroupsNumForUEID</em>: number of subgroups for UE_ID based
subgrouping in a PO, which is broadcasted in system information.</p>
<p>UE's subgroup can be either assigned by CN as specified in clause
7.3.1 or formed based on UE_ID as specified in clause 7.3.2:</p>
<p>- If <em>subgroupsNumForUEID</em> is absent in
<em>subgroupConfig</em>, the subgroup ID based on CN assigned
subgrouping as specified in clause 7.3.1, if available for the UE, is
used in the cell.</p>
<p>- If both <em>subgroupsNumPerPO</em> and <em>subgroupsNumForUEID</em>
are configured, and <em>subgroupsNumForUEID</em> has the same value as
<em>subgroupsNumPerPO</em>, the subgroup ID based on UE_ID based
subgrouping as specified in clause 7.3.2 is used in the cell.</p>
<p>- If both <em>subgroupsNumPerPO</em> and <em>subgroupsNumForUEID</em>
are configured, and <em>subgroupsNumForUEID</em> &lt;
<em>subgroupsNumPerPO</em>:</p>
<p>- The subgroup ID based on CN assigned subgrouping as specified in
clause 7.3.1, if available for the UE, is used in the cell;</p>
<p>- Otherwise, the subgroup ID based on UE_ID based subgrouping as
specified in clause 7.3.2 is used in the cell.</p>
<p>If a UE has no CN assigned subgroup ID or does not support CN
assigned subgrouping, and there is no configuration for
<em>subgroupsNumForUEID</em>, the UE monitors the associated PO
according to clause 7.1.</p>
<h3 id="cn-assigned-subgrouping">7.3.1 CN assigned subgrouping</h3>
<p>Paging with CN assigned subgrouping is used in the cell which
supports CN assigned subgrouping, as described in clause 7.3.0. A UE
supporting CN assigned subgrouping in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state can
be assigned a subgroup ID (between 0 to 7) by AMF through NAS
signalling. The UE belonging to the assigned subgroup ID monitors its
associated PEI which indicates the paged subgroup(s) as specified in
clause 7.2.</p>
<h3 id="ue_id-based-subgrouping">7.3.2 UE_ID based subgrouping</h3>
<p>Paging with UE_ID based subgrouping is used in the cell which
supports UE_ID based subgrouping, as described in clause 7.3.0.</p>
<p>If the UE is not configured with a CN assigned subgroup ID, or if the
UE configured with a CN assigned subgroup ID is in a cell supporting
only UE_ID based subgrouping, the subgroup ID of the UE is determined by
the formula below:</p>
<p>SubgroupID = (floor(UE_ID/(N*Ns)) mod subgroupsNumForUEID) +
(subgroupsNumPerPO - subgroupsNumForUEID),</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>N: number of total paging frames in T, which is the DRX cycle of
RRC_IDLE state as specified in clause 7.1</p>
<p>Ns: number of paging occasions for a PF</p>
<p>UE_ID: 5G-S-TMSI mod X, where X is 32768, if eDRX is applied;
otherwise, X is 8192</p>
<p>subgroupsNumForUEID: number of subgroups for UE_ID based subgrouping
in a PO, which is broadcasted in system information</p>
<p>In RRC_INACTIVE state with CN configured PTW the SubgroupID used
outside CN PTW is the same as the SubgroupID used inside CN PTW.</p>
<p>The UE belonging to the SubgroupID monitors its associated PEI which
indicates the paged subgroup(s) as specified in clause 7.2.</p>
<h2 id="paging-in-extended-drx">7.4 Paging in extended DRX</h2>
<p>The UE may be configured by upper layers and/or RRC with an extended
DRX (eDRX) cycle T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub> and/or T<sub>eDRX, RAN</sub>. The
UE operates in eDRX for CN paging in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE states if
the UE is configured for eDRX by upper layers and
<em>eDRX-AllowedIdle</em> is signalled in SIB1. The UE operates in eDRX
for RAN paging in RRC_INACTIVE state if the UE is configured for eDRX by
RAN and <em>eDRX-Allowed</em>I<em>nactive</em> is signalled in SIB1. If
the UE operates in eDRX with an eDRX cycle no longer than 1024 radio
frames, it monitors POs as defined in 7.1 with configured eDRX cycle.
Otherwise, a UE operating in eDRX monitors POs as defined in 7.1 during
a periodic Paging Time Window (PTW) configured for the UE. The PTW is
UE-specific and is determined by a Paging Hyperframe (PH), a starting
position within the PH (PTW_start) and an ending position (PTW_end). PH,
PTW_start and PTW_end are given by the following formula:</p>
<p>The PH for CN is the H-SFN satisfying the following equations:</p>
<p>H-SFN mod T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>= (UE_ID_H mod T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>),
where</p>
<p>- UE_ID_H: 13 most significant bits of the Hashed ID.</p>
<p>- T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>: UE-specific eDRX cycle in Hyper-frames,
(T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub> = 2, …, 1024 Hyper-frames) configured by upper
layers.</p>
<p>PTW_start denotes the first radio frame of the PH that is part of the
PTW and has SFN satisfying the following equation:</p>
<p>SFN = 128 * i<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>, where</p>
<p>- i<sub>eDRX, CN</sub> = floor(UE_ID_H /T<sub>eDRX, CN</sub>) mod
8</p>
<p>PTW_end is the last radio frame of the PTW and has SFN satisfying the
following equation:</p>
<p>SFN = (PTW_start + L*100 - 1) mod 1024, where</p>
<p>- L = Paging Time Window (PTW) length (in seconds) configured by
upper layers</p>
<p>Hashed ID is defined as follows:</p>
<p>Hashed_ID is Frame Check Sequence (FCS) for the bits b31, b30…, b0 of
5G-S-TMSI.</p>
<p>5G-S-TMSI = &lt;b47, b46, …, b0&gt; as defined in TS 23.003 [23].</p>
<p>The 32-bit FCS shall be the ones complement of the sum (modulo 2) of
Y1 and Y2, where</p>
<p>- Y1 is the remainder of x<sup>k</sup> (x<sup>31</sup> +
