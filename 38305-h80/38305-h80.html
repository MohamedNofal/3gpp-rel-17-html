<h1 id="scope"><br />
1 Scope</h1>
<p>The present document specifies the stage 2 of the UE Positioning
function of NG-RAN which provides the mechanisms to support or assist
the calculation of the geographical position of a UE. UE position
knowledge can be used, for example, in support of Radio Resource
Management functions, as well as location-based services for operators,
subscribers, and third-party service providers. The purpose of this
stage 2 specification is to define the NG-RAN UE Positioning
architecture, functional entities and operations to support positioning
methods. This description is confined to the NG-RAN Access Stratum. It
does not define or describe how the results of the UE position
calculation can be utilised in the Core Network (e.g., LCS) or in NG-RAN
(e.g., RRM).</p>
<p>UE Positioning may be considered as a network-provided enabling
technology consisting of standardised service capabilities that enable
the provision of location applications. The application(s) may be
service provider specific. The description of the numerous and varied
possible location applications which are enabled by this technology is
outside the scope of the present document. However, clarifying examples
of how the functionality being described may be used to provide specific
location services may be included.</p>
<p>This stage 2 specification covers the NG-RAN positioning methods,
state descriptions, and message flows to support UE Positioning.</p>

<h1 id="definitions-symbols-and-abbreviations">3 Definitions, symbols
and abbreviations</h1>
<h2 id="definitions">3.1 Definitions</h2>
<p>For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term,
if any, in TR 21.905 [1].</p>
<p>As used in this document, the suffixes "-based" and "-assisted" refer
respectively to the node that is responsible for making the positioning
calculation (and which may also provide measurements) and a node that
provides measurements (but which does not make the positioning
calculation). Thus, an operation in which measurements are provided by
the UE to the LMF to be used in the computation of a position estimate
is described as "UE-assisted" (and could also be called "LMF-based"),
while one in which the UE computes its own position is described as
"UE-based".</p>
<p><strong>Alert Limit (AL)</strong>: The maximum allowable positioning
error for the purpose of integrity. If the positioning error is beyond
this limit, the integrity results of the calculated location may not
meet the integrity requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Positioning integrity</strong>: A measure of the trust in the
accuracy of the position-related data and the ability to provide
associated alerts.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-configured assistance data</strong>: Refers to the DL-PRS
assistance data (with associated validity criteria) that can be provided
to the UE (before or during an ongoing LPP positioning session), to be
then utilized for potential positioning measurements at a future time
(e.g. for deferred MT-LR). Pre-configured DL-PRS assistance data may
consist of multiple instances, where each instance is applicable to a
different area within the network.</p>
<p><strong>Protection Level (PL):</strong> A statistical upper-bound of
the Positioning Error (PE) that ensures that, the probability per unit
of time of the true error being greater than the AL and the PL being
less than or equal to the AL, for longer than the TTA, is less than the
TIR, i.e., the PL satisfies the following inequality:<br />
<em>Prob per unit of time</em> [((<em>PE&gt;AL</em>) &amp;
(<em>PL&lt;=AL</em>)) <em>for longer than TTA</em>] <em>&lt;
TIR</em><br />
When the PL bounds the positioning error in the horizontal plane or on
the vertical axis then it is called Horizontal Protection Level (HPL) or
Vertical Protection Level (VPL) respectively.<br />
A specific equation for the PL is not specified as this is
implementation-defined. For the PL to be considered valid, it must
simply satisfy the inequality above.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: the PL inequality is valid for all values of the AL.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: the TIR may correspond to the achievable TIR in the case that
the requested TIR cannot be satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>PRS-only TP</strong>: A TP which only transmits PRS, DL-PRS
signals and is not associated with a cell.</p>
<p><strong>PRS Processing Window (PPW):</strong> The PRS Processing
Window is configured by the network to a UE for NR DL-PRS measurements
without measurement gap.</p>
<p><strong>Reception Point (RP)</strong>: A set of geographically
co-located receive antennas (e.g. antenna array (with one or more
antenna elements)) for one cell, part of one cell or one UL-SRS-only RP.
Reception Points can include base station (ng-eNB or gNB) antennas,
remote radio heads, a remote antenna of a base station, an antenna of a
UL-SRS-only RP, etc. One cell can include one or multiple reception
points. For a homogeneous deployment, each reception point may
correspond to one cell.</p>
<p><strong>Rx Time Delay:</strong> From a signal reception perspective,
there will be a time delay from the time when the RF signal arrives at
the Rx antenna to the time when the signal is digitized and time-stamped
at the baseband.</p>
<p><strong>Rx Timing Error:</strong> Result of Rx time delay involved in
the reception of a signal before reporting measurements that are
obtained from the signal. It is the uncalibrated Rx time delay, or the
remaining delay after the UE/TRP internal calibration/compensation of
the Rx time delay, involved in the reception of the DL-PRS/UL SRS
signals. The calibration/compensation may also include the
calibration/compensation of the relative time delay between different RF
chains in the same UE/TRP and may also possibly consider the offset of
the Rx antenna phase centre to the physical antenna centre.</p>
<p><strong>SRS-only RP</strong>: An RP which only receives UL-SRS
signals and is not associated with a cell.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission Point (TP)</strong>: A set of geographically
co-located transmit antennas (e.g. antenna array (with one or more
antenna elements)) for one cell, part of one cell or one DL-PRS-only TP.
Transmission Points can include base station (ng-eNB or gNB) antennas,
remote radio heads, a remote antenna of a base station, an antenna of a
DL-PRS-only TP, etc. One cell can include one or multiple transmission
points. For a homogeneous deployment, each transmission point may
correspond to one cell.</p>
<p><strong>Transmission-Reception Point (TRP)</strong>: A set of
geographically co-located antennas (e.g. antenna array (with one or more
antenna elements)) supporting TP and/or RP functionality.</p>
<p><strong>TRP Rx 'Timing Error Group' (TRP Rx TEG):</strong> Rx timing
errors, associated with TRP reporting of one or more UL measurements,
that are within a certain margin.</p>
<p><strong>TRP RxTx 'Timing Error Group' (TRP RxTx TEG):</strong> Rx
timing errors and Tx timing errors, associated with TRP reporting of one
or more gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements, which have the 'Rx
timing errors+Tx timing errors' differences within a certain margin.</p>
<p><strong>TRP Tx 'Timing Error Troup' (TRP Tx TEG):</strong> Tx timing
errors, associated with TRP transmissions on one or more DL-PRS
resources, that are within a certain margin.</p>
<p><strong>Tx Time Delay:</strong> From a signal transmission
perspective, the time delay from the time when the digital signal is
generated at baseband to the time when the RF signal is transmitted from
the Tx antenna.</p>
<p><strong>Tx Timing Error:</strong> Result of Tx time delay involved in
the transmission of a signal. It is the uncalibrated Tx time delay, or
the remaining delay after the TRP/UE internal calibration/compensation
of the Tx time delay, involved in the transmission of the DL-PRS/UL SRS
signals. The calibration/compensation may also include the
calibration/compensation of the relative time delay between different RF
chains in the same TRP/UE and may also possibly consider the offset of
the Tx antenna phase centre to the physical antenna centre.</p>
<p><strong>UE Rx 'Timing Error Group' (UE Rx TEG):</strong> Rx timing
errors, associated with UE reporting of one or more DL measurements
(RSTD), that are within a certain margin.</p>
<p><strong>UE RxTx 'Timing Error Group' (UE RxTx TEG):</strong> Rx
timing errors and Tx timing errors, associated with UE reporting of one
or more UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements, which have the 'Rx timing
errors+Tx timing errors' differences within a certain margin.</p>
<p><strong>UE Tx 'Timing Error Group' (UE Tx TEG):</strong> Tx timing
errors, associated with UE transmissions on one or more UL SRS resources
for positioning purpose, that are within a certain margin.</p>

<h1 id="main-concepts-and-requirements">4 Main concepts and
requirements</h1>
<h2 id="assumptions-and-generalities">4.1 Assumptions and
Generalities</h2>
<p>The stage 1 description of LCS at the service level is provided in TS
22.071 [3]; the stage 2 LCS functional description, including the LCS
system architecture and message flows, is provided in TS 23.501 [2], TS
23.502 [26] and TS 23.273 [35].</p>
<p>Positioning functionality provides a means to determine the
geographic position and/or velocity of the UE based on measuring radio
signals. The position information may be requested by and reported to a
client (e.g., an application) associated with the UE, or by a client
within or attached to the core network. The position information shall
be reported in standard formats, such as those for cell-based or
geographical co-ordinates, together with the estimated errors
(uncertainty) of the position and velocity of the UE and, if available,
the positioning method (or the list of the methods) used to obtain the
position estimate.</p>
<p>Restrictions on the geographic shape encoded within the 'position
information' parameter may exist for certain LCS client types. The 5GS,
including NG-RAN, shall comply with any shape restrictions defined in
5GS and, in a particular country, with any shape restrictions defined
for a specific LCS client type in relevant national standards. For
example, in the US, national standard J-STD-036-C-2 restricts the
geographic shape for an emergency services LCS client to minimally
either an "ellipsoid point" or an "ellipsoid point with uncertainty
circle" as defined in TS 23.032 [4].</p>
<p>It shall be possible for the majority of the UEs within a network to
use the LCS feature without compromising the radio transmission or
signalling capabilities of the NG-RAN.</p>
<p>The uncertainty of the position measurement shall be
network-implementation-dependent, at the choice of the network operator.
The uncertainty may vary between networks as well as from one area
within a network to another. The uncertainty may be hundreds of metres
in some areas and only a few metres in others. In the event that a
particular position measurement is provided through a UE-assisted
process, the uncertainty may also depend on the capabilities of the UE.
In some jurisdictions, there is a regulatory requirement for location
service accuracy that is part of an emergency service. Further details
of the accuracy requirements can be found in TS 22.071 [3].</p>
<p>The uncertainty of the position information is dependent on the
method used, the position of the UE within the coverage area and the
activity of the UE. Several design options of the NG-RAN system (e.g.,
size of cell, adaptive antenna technique, pathloss estimation, timing
accuracy, ng-eNB and gNB surveys) shall allow the network operator to
choose a suitable and cost-effective UE positioning method for their
market.</p>
<p>There are many different possible uses for the positioning
information. The positioning functions may be used internally by the
5GS, by value-added network services, by the UE itself or through the
network, and by "third party" services. The feature may also be used by
an emergency service (which may be mandated or "value-added"), but the
location service is not exclusively for emergencies.</p>
<p>Design of the NG-RAN positioning capability as documented in this
specification includes position methods, protocols and procedures that
are either adapted from capabilities already supported for E-UTRAN,
UTRAN and GERAN, or created separately from first principles. In
contrast to GERAN and UTRAN but similarly to E-UTRAN, the NG-RAN
positioning capabilities are intended to be forward compatible to other
access types and other position methods, in an effort to reduce the
amount of additional positioning support needed in the future. This goal
also extends to user plane location solutions such as OMA SUPL ([15],
[16]), for which NG-RAN positioning capabilities are intended to be
compatible where appropriate.</p>
<p>As a basis for the operation of UE Positioning in NG-RAN, the
following assumptions apply:</p>
<p>- both TDD and FDD will be supported;</p>
<p>- the provision of the UE Positioning function in NG-RAN and 5GC is
optional through support of the specified method(s) in the ng-eNB, gNB
and the LMF;</p>
<p>- UE Positioning is applicable to any target UE, whether or not the
UE supports LCS, but with restrictions on the use of certain positioning
methods depending on UE capability (e.g. as defined within the LPP
protocol);</p>
<p>- the positioning information may be used for internal system
operations to improve system performance;</p>
<p>- the UE Positioning architecture and functions shall include the
option to accommodate several techniques of measurement and processing
to ensure evolution to follow changing service requirements and to take
advantage of advancing technology.</p>
<h2 id="role-of-ue-positioning-methods">4.2 Role of UE Positioning
Methods</h2>
<p>The NG-RAN may utilise one or more positioning methods in order to
determine the position of an UE.</p>
<p>Positioning the UE involves two main steps:</p>
<p>- signal measurements; and</p>
<p>- position estimate and optional velocity computation based on the
measurements.</p>
<p>The signal measurements may be made by the UE or by the serving
ng-eNB or gNB. The basic signals measured for terrestrial position
methods are typically the LTE or NR radio transmissions; however, other
methods may make use of other transmissions such as general radio
navigation signals including those from Global Navigation Satellites
Systems (GNSSs).</p>
<p>The positioning function should not be limited to a single method or
measurement. That is, it should be capable of utilising other standard
methods and measurements, as such methods and measurements are available
and appropriate, to meet the required service needs of the location
service client. This additional information could consist of readily
available E-UTRAN or NG-RAN measurements.</p>
<p>The position estimate computation may be made by the UE or by the
LMF.</p>
<h2 id="standard-ue-positioning-methods">4.3 Standard UE Positioning

<h3 id="introduction">4.3.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The standard positioning methods supported for NG-RAN access are:</p>
<p>- network-assisted GNSS methods;</p>

<p>- WLAN positioning;</p>
<p>- Bluetooth positioning;</p>
<p>- terrestrial beacon system (TBS) positioning;</p>
<p>- sensor based methods:</p>

<p>Sensor, WLAN, Bluetooth, and TBS positioning methods based on MBS
signals are also supported in standalone mode, as described in the
corresponding clauses.</p>
<h3 id="network-assisted-gnss-methods">4.3.2 Network-assisted GNSS
methods</h3>
<p>These methods make use of UEs that are equipped with radio receivers
capable of receiving GNSS signals. In 3GPP specifications the term GNSS
encompasses both global and regional/augmentation navigation satellite
systems.</p>
<p>Examples of global navigation satellite systems include GPS,
Modernized GPS, Galileo, GLONASS, and BeiDou Navigation Satellite System
(BDS). Regional navigation satellite systems include Quasi Zenith
Satellite System (QZSS), and NAVigation with Indian Constellation
(NavIC), while the many augmentation systems, listed in 8.1.1, are
classified under the generic term of Space Based Augmentation Systems
(SBAS) and provide regional augmentation services.</p>
<p>In this concept, different GNSSs (e.g. GPS, Galileo, etc.) can be
used separately or in combination to determine the location of a UE.</p>
<p>The operation of the network-assisted GNSS methods is described in
clause 8.1.</p>
<h3 id="otdoa-positioning">4.3.3 OTDOA positioning</h3>
<p>The OTDOA positioning method makes use of the measured timing of
downlink signals received from multiple TPs, comprising eNBs, ng-eNBs
and PRS-only TPs, at the UE. The UE measures the timing of the received
signals using assistance data received from the positioning server, and
the resulting measurements are used to locate the UE in relation to the
neighbouring TPs.</p>
<p>The operation of the OTDOA method is described in clause 8.2.</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-cell-id-methods">4.3.4 Enhanced Cell ID methods</h3>
<p>In the Cell ID (CID) positioning method, the position of an UE is
estimated with the knowledge of its serving ng-eNB, gNB and cell. The
information about the serving ng-eNB, gNB and cell may be obtained by
paging, registration, or other methods.</p>
<p>Enhanced Cell ID (E‑CID) based on LTE signals positioning refers to
techniques which use additional UE measurements and/or NG-RAN radio
resource and other measurements to improve the UE location estimate. In
the case of a serving ng-eNB, uplink E-CID may be supported based on NR,
GERAN, UTRA or WLAN signals.</p>
<p>Although E-CID based on LTE signals positioning may utilise some of
the same measurements as the measurement control system in the RRC
protocol, the UE generally is not expected to make additional
measurements for the sole purpose of positioning; i.e., the positioning
procedures do not supply a measurement configuration or measurement
control message, and the UE reports the measurements that it has
available rather than being required to take additional measurement
actions.</p>
<p>In cases with a requirement for close time coupling between UE and
ng-eNB measurements (e.g., T<sub>ADV</sub> type 1 and UE E-UTRA Rx-Tx
time difference), the ng-eNB configures the appropriate RRC measurements
and is responsible for maintaining the required coupling between the
measurements.</p>
<p>The operation of the Enhanced Cell ID based on LTE signals method is
described in clause 8.3.</p>
<h3 id="barometric-pressure-sensor-positioning">4.3.5 Barometric
pressure sensor positioning</h3>
<p>The barometric pressure sensor method makes use of barometric sensors
to determine the vertical component of the position of the UE. The UE
measures barometric pressure, optionally aided by assistance data, to
calculate the vertical component of its location or to send measurements
to the positioning server for position calculation.</p>
<p>This method should be combined with other positioning methods to
determine the 3D position of the UE.</p>
<p>The operation of the Barometric pressure sensor positioning method is
described in clause 8.4.</p>
<h3 id="wlan-positioning">4.3.6 WLAN positioning</h3>
<p>The WLAN positioning method makes use of the WLAN measurements (AP
identifiers and optionally other measurements) and databases to
determine the location of the UE. The UE measures received signals from
WLAN [21] access points, optionally aided by assistance data, to send
measurements to the positioning server for position calculation. Using
the measurement results and a references database, the location of the
UE is calculated.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the UE makes use of WLAN measurements and optionally
WLAN AP assistance data provided by the positioning server, to determine
its location.</p>
<p>The operation of the WLAN positioning method is described in clause
8.5.</p>
<h3 id="bluetooth-positioning">4.3.7 Bluetooth positioning</h3>
<p>The Bluetooth positioning method makes use of Bluetooth measurements
(beacon identifiers and optionally other measurements) to determine the
location of the UE. The UE measures received signals from Bluetooth [22]
beacons. Using the measurement results and a references database, the
location of the UE is calculated. The Bluetooth methods may be combined
with other positioning methods (e.g. WLAN) to improve positioning
accuracy of the UE.</p>
<p>The operation of the Bluetooth positioning method is described in
clause 8.6.</p>
<h3 id="tbs-positioning">4.3.8 TBS positioning</h3>
<p>A Terrestrial Beacon System (TBS) consists of a network of
ground-based transmitters, broadcasting signals only for positioning
purposes. The current type of TBS positioning signals are the MBS
(Metropolitan Beacon System) signals [23] and Positioning Reference
Signals (PRS) (TS 36.211 [24]). The UE measures received TBS signals,
optionally aided by assistance data, to calculate its location or to
send measurements to the positioning server for position
calculation.</p>
<p>The operation of the TBS positioning method based on MBS signals is
described in clause 8.7.</p>
<p>TBS positioning based on PRS signals is part of OTDOA positioning and
described in clause 8.2.</p>
<h3 id="motion-sensor-positioning">4.3.9 Motion sensor positioning</h3>
<p>The motion sensor method makes use of different sensors such as
accelerometers, gyros, magnetometers, to calculate the displacement of
UE. The UE estimates a relative displacement based upon a reference
position and/or reference time. UE sends a report comprising the
determined relative displacement which can be used to determine the
absolute position.</p>
<p>This method should be used with other positioning methods for hybrid
positioning.</p>
<p>The operation of the sensor positioning method is described in clause
8.8.</p>
<h3 id="nr-enhanced-cell-id-methods">4.3.10 NR Enhanced Cell ID
methods</h3>
<p>NR Enhanced Cell ID (NR E‑CID) positioning refers to techniques which
use additional UE measurements and/or gNB measurements to improve the UE
location estimate.</p>
<p>Although NR E-CID positioning may utilise some of the same
measurements as the measurement control system in the RRC protocol, the
UE generally is not expected to make additional measurements for the
sole purpose of positioning; i.e., the positioning procedures do not
supply a measurement configuration or measurement control message, and
the UE reports the measurements that it has available rather than being
required to take additional measurement actions.</p>
<p>The operation of the NR Enhanced Cell ID method is described in
clause 8.9.</p>
<h3 id="multi-rtt-positioning">4.3.11 Multi-RTT positioning</h3>
<p>The Multi-RTT positioning method makes use of the UE Rx-Tx time
difference measurements (and optionally DL-PRS-RSRP and/or DL-PRS-RSRPP)
of downlink signals received from multiple TRPs, measured by the UE and
the measured gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements (and optionally
UL-SRS-RSRP and/or UL-SRS-RSRPP) at multiple TRPs of uplink signals
transmitted from UE.</p>
<p>The UE measures the UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements (and
optionally DL-PRS-RSRP and/or DL-PRS-RSRPP of the received signals)
using assistance data received from the positioning server, and the TRPs
measure the gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements (and optionally
UL-SRS-RSRP and/or UL-SRS-RSRPP of the received signals) using
assistance data received from the positioning server. The measurements
are used to determine the RTT at the positioning server which are used
to estimate the location of the UE.</p>
<p>The operation of the Multi-RTT positioning method is described in
clause 8.10.</p>
<h3 id="dl-aod-positioning">4.3.12 DL-AoD positioning</h3>
<p>The DL-AoD positioning method makes use of the measured DL-PRS-RSRP
(and optionally DL-PRS-RSRPP) of downlink signals received from multiple
TPs, at the UE. The UE measures the DL-PRS-RSRP (and optionally
DL-PRS-RSRPP) of the received signals using assistance data received
from the positioning server, and the resulting measurements are used
along with other configuration information to locate the UE in relation
to the neighbouring TPs.</p>
<p>The operation of the DL-AoD positioning method is described in clause
8.11.</p>
<h3 id="dl-tdoa-positioning">4.3.13 DL-TDOA positioning</h3>
<p>The DL-TDOA positioning method makes use of the DL RSTD (and
optionally DL-PRS-RSRP and/or DL-PRS-RSRPP) of downlink signals received
from multiple TPs, at the UE. The UE measures the DL RSTD (and
optionally DL-PRS-RSRP and/or DL-PRS-RSRPP) of the received signals
using assistance data received from the positioning server, and the
resulting measurements are used along with other configuration
information to locate the UE in relation to the neighbouring TPs.</p>
<p>The operation of the DL-TDOA positioning method is described in
clause 8.12.</p>
<h3 id="ul-tdoa-positioning">4.3.14 UL-TDOA positioning</h3>
<p>The UL-TDOA positioning method makes use of the UL-RTOA (and
optionally UL-SRS-RSRP and/or UL-SRS-RSRPP) at multiple RPs of uplink
signals transmitted from UE. The RPs measure the UL-RTOA (and optionally
UL-SRS-RSRP and/or UL-SRS-RSRPP) of the received signals using
assistance data received from the positioning server, and the resulting
measurements are used along with other configuration information to
estimate the location of the UE.</p>
<p>The operation of the UL-TDOA positioning method is described in
clause 8.13.</p>
<h3 id="ul-aoa">4.3.15 UL-AoA</h3>
<p>The UL-AoA positioning method makes use of the measured azimuth angle
of arrival (A-AoA) and/or zenith angle of arrival (Z-AoA) at multiple
RPs of uplink signals transmitted from the UE. The RPs measure A-AoA and
Z-AoA (and optionally UL-SRS-RSRP and/or UL-SRS-RSRPP) of the received
signals using assistance data received from the positioning server, and
the resulting measurements are used along with other configuration
information to estimate the location of the UE.</p>
<p>The operation of the UL-AoA positioning method is described in clause
8.14.</p>
<h1 id="ng-ran-ue-positioning-architecture">5 NG-RAN UE Positioning
Architecture</h1>
<h2 id="architecture">5.1 Architecture</h2>
<p>Figure 5.1-1 shows the architecture in 5GS applicable to positioning
of a UE with NR or E-UTRA access.</p>
<p>The AMF receives a request for some location service associated with
a particular target UE from another entity (e.g., GMLC or UE) or the AMF
itself decides to initiate some location service on behalf of a
particular target UE (e.g., for an IMS emergency call from the UE) as
described in TS 23.502 [26] and TS 23.273 [35]. The AMF then sends a
location services request to an LMF. The LMF processes the location
services request which may include transferring assistance data to the
target UE to assist with UE-based and/or UE-assisted positioning and/or
may include positioning of the target UE. The LMF then returns the
result of the location service back to the AMF (e.g., a position
estimate for the UE. In the case of a location service requested by an
entity other than the AMF (e.g., a GMLC or UE), the AMF returns the
location service result to this entity.</p>
<p>An NG-RAN node may control several TRPs/TPs, such as remote radio
heads, or DL-PRS-only TPs for support of PRS-based TBS.</p>
<p>An LMF may have a proprietary signalling connection to an E-SMLC
which may enable an LMF to access information from E‑UTRAN (e.g. to
support the OTDOA for E-UTRA positioning method using downlink
measurements obtained by a target UE of signals from eNBs and/or
PRS-only TPs in E-UTRAN). Details of the signalling interaction between
an LMF and E-SMLC are outside the scope of this specification.</p>
<p>An LMF may have a proprietary signalling connection to an SLP. The
SLP is the SUPL entity responsible for positioning over the user plane.
Further details of user-plane positioning are provided in [15][16].
Details of the signalling interaction between an LMF and SLP are outside
the scope of this specification.</p>

<p>NOTE 2: Void</p>
<p>NOTE 3: Void</p>
<p>In case of split gNB architecture, a gNB-DU may include TRP
functionality where the TRP functionality may support functions for a
TP, RP or both TP and RP. A gNB-DU which includes TRP functionality does
not need to offer cell services.</p>
<h2 id="ue-positioning-operations">5.2 UE Positioning Operations</h2>
<p>To support positioning of a target UE and delivery of location
assistance data to a UE with NG-RAN access in 5GS, location related
functions are distributed as shown in the architecture in Figure 5.1-1
and as clarified in greater detail in TS 23.501 [2] and TS 23.273 [35].
The overall sequence of events applicable to the UE, NG-RAN and LMF for
any location service is shown in Figure 5.2-1.</p>
<p>Note that when the AMF receives a Location Service Request in case of
the UE is in CM-IDLE state, the AMF performs a network triggered service
request as defined in TS 23.502 [26] and TS 23.273 [35] in order to
establish a signalling connection with the UE and assign a specific
serving gNB or ng-eNB. The UE is assumed to be in connected mode before
the beginning of the flow shown in the Figure 5.2-1; that is, any
signalling that might be required to bring the UE to connected mode
prior to step 1a is not shown. The signalling connection may, however,
be later released (e.g. by the NG-RAN node as a result of signalling and
data inactivity) while positioning is still ongoing.</p>
<p><img src="media/image4.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 5.2-1: Location Service Support by NG-RAN</p>
<p>1a. Either: some entity in the 5GC (e.g. GMLC) requests some location
service (e.g. positioning) for a target UE to the serving AMF.</p>
<p>1b. Or: the serving AMF for a target UE determines the need for some
location service (e.g. to locate the UE for an emergency call).</p>
<p>1c. Or: the UE requests some location service (e.g. positioning or
delivery of assistance data) to the serving AMF at the NAS level.</p>
<p>2. The AMF transfers the location service request to an LMF.</p>
<p>3a. The LMF instigates location procedures with the serving and
possibly neighbouring ng-eNB or gNB in the NG-RAN – e.g. to obtain
positioning measurements or assistance data.</p>
<p>3b. In addition to step 3a or instead of step 3a, the LMF instigates
location procedures with the UE – e.g. to obtain a location estimate or
positioning measurements or to transfer location assistance data to the
UE.</p>
<p>4. The LMF provides a location service response to the AMF and
includes any needed results – e.g. success or failure indication and, if
requested and obtained, a location estimate for the UE.</p>
<p>5a. If step 1a was performed, the AMF returns a location service
response to the 5GC entity in step 1a and includes any needed results –
e.g. a location estimate for the UE.</p>
<p>5b. If step 1b occurred, the AMF uses the location service response
received in step 4 to assist the service that triggered this in step 1b
(e.g. may provide a location estimate associated with an emergency call
to a GMLC).</p>
<p>5c. If step 1c was performed, the AMF returns a location service
response to the UE and includes any needed results – e.g. a location
estimate for the UE.</p>
<p>Location procedures applicable to NG-RAN occur in steps 3a and 3b in
Figure 5.2-1 and are defined in greater detail in this specification.
Other steps in Figure 5.2-1 are applicable only to the 5GC and are
described in greater detail and in TS 23.502 [26] and TS 23.273
[35].</p>
<p>Steps 3a and 3b can involve the use of different position methods to
obtain location related measurements for a target UE and from these
compute a location estimate and possibly additional information like
velocity. Positioning methods supported in this release are summarized
in clause 4.3 and described in detail in clause 8.</p>
<p>The case that the NG-RAN node functions as an LCS client is not
supported in this version of the specification.</p>
<h2 id="ng-ran-positioning-operations">5.3 NG-RAN Positioning
Operations</h2>
<h3 id="general-ng-ran-positioning-operations">5.3.1 General NG-RAN
Positioning Operations</h3>
<p>Separately from location service support for particular UEs, an LMF
may interact with elements in the NG-RAN in order to obtain measurement
information to help assist one or more position methods for all UEs. An
LMF may also interact with NG-RAN node to provide assistance data
information for broadcasting.</p>
<h3 id="otdoa-positioning-support">5.3.2 OTDOA Positioning Support</h3>
<p>An LMF can interact with any ng-eNB reachable from any of the AMFs
with signalling access to the LMF in order to obtain location related
information to support the OTDOA for E-UTRA positioning method,
including PRS-based TBS for E-UTRA. The information can include timing
information for the TP in relation to either absolute GNSS time or
timing of other TPs and information about the supported cells and TPs
including PRS schedule.</p>
<p>Signalling access between the LMF and ng-eNB may be via any AMF with
signalling access to both the LMF and ng‑eNB.</p>
<p>An LMF can also interact with any gNB reachable from any of the AMFs
with signalling access to the LMF in order to obtain NR cell timing
information to support the OTDOA for E-UTRA positioning method, in case
the UE is served by a NR cell.</p>
<h3 id="assistance-information-broadcast-support">5.3.3 Assistance
Information Broadcast Support</h3>
<p>An LMF can interact with any NG-RAN node reachable from any of the
AMFs with signalling access to the LMF in order to provide assistance
data information for broadcasting. The information can include
positioning System Information Blocks (posSIBs) together with assistance
information meta data, broadcast cells and broadcast periodicity.</p>
<p>Signalling access between the LMF and NG-RAN node is via any AMF with
signalling access to both the LMF and NG-RAN node.</p>
<h3 id="nr-rat-dependent-positioning-support">5.3.4 NR RAT-Dependent
Positioning Support</h3>
<p>An LMF can interact with any gNB reachable from any of the AMFs with
signalling access to the LMF in order to obtain location related
information to support the NR RAT-Dependent positioning methods. The
information can include timing information for the TRP in relation to
either absolute GNSS time or timing of other TRPs and information about
the supported cells and TRPs including PRS schedule.</p>
<p>When an LMF determines a positioning method for a UE, which requires
gNB measurements, the LMF can interact with the gNB to support the
positioning method. The LMF can request the gNB for SRS configuration
for the UE and the gNB can respond with the SRS configuration to the
LMF. The gNB can provide an updated SRS configuration to the LMF when
the SRS configuration changes. If semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS is
configured to the UE, the LMF may activate/deactivate the SRS. When the
SRS is transmitted by the UE, the LMF can request multiple TRPs to
perform uplink measurements and report the results.</p>
<p>Signalling access between the LMF and gNB for non-UE associated NRPPa
procedure in Clause 7.2.1 may be via any AMF with signalling access to
both the LMF and gNB. Signalling access between the LMF and gNB for UE
associated NRPPa procedure in Clause 7.2.1 is via the serving AMF, as in
TS 23.273 [35].</p>

Functional Description of Elements Related to UE Positioning in
NG-RAN</h2>
<h3 id="user-equipment-ue">5.4.1 User Equipment (UE)</h3>
<p>The UE may make measurements of downlink signals from NG-RAN and
other sources such as E-UTRAN, different GNSS and TBS systems, WLAN
access points, Bluetooth beacons, UE barometric pressure and motion
sensors. The measurements to be made will be determined by the chosen
positioning method.</p>
<p>The UE may also contain LCS applications, or access an LCS
application either through communication with a network accessed by the
UE or through another application residing in the UE. This LCS
application may include the needed measurement and calculation functions
to determine the UE's position with or without network assistance. This
is outside of the scope of this specification.</p>
<p>The UE may also, for example, contain an independent positioning
function (e.g., GPS) and thus be able to report its position,
independent of the NG-RAN transmissions. The UE with an independent
positioning function may also make use of assistance information
obtained from the network.</p>
<h3 id="gnb">5.4.2 gNB</h3>
<p>The gNB is a network element of NG-RAN that may provide measurement
information for a target UE and communicates this information to an
LMF.</p>
<p>To support NR RAT-Dependent positioning, the gNB may make
measurements of radio signals for a target UE, and provide measurement
results for position estimation. A gNB may serve several TRPs, including
for example remote radio heads, and UL-SRS only RPs and DL-PRS-only
TPs.</p>
<p>A gNB may broadcast assistance data information, received from an
LMF, in positioning System Information messages.</p>
<h3 id="ng-enb">5.4.3 ng-eNB</h3>
<p>The ng-eNB is a network element of NG-RAN that may provide
measurement results for position estimation and makes measurements of
radio signals for a target UE and communicates these measurements to an
LMF.</p>
<p>The ng-eNB makes its measurements in response to requests from the
LMF (on demand or periodically).</p>
<p>An ng-eNB may serve several TPs, including for example remote radio
heads and PRS-only TPs for PRS-based TBS positioning for E-UTRA.</p>
<p>An ng-eNB may broadcast assistance data information, received from an
LMF, in positioning System Information messages.</p>
<h3 id="location-management-function-lmf">5.4.4 Location Management
Function (LMF)</h3>
<p>The LMF manages the support of different location services for target
UEs, including positioning of UEs and delivery of assistance data to
UEs. The LMF may interact with the serving gNB or serving ng-eNB for a
target UE in order to obtain position measurements for the UE, including
uplink measurements made by an NG-RAN and downlink measurements made by
the UE that were provided to an NG-RAN as part of other functions such
as for support of handover.</p>
<p>The LMF may interact with a target UE in order to deliver assistance
data if requested for a particular location service, or to obtain a
location estimate if that was requested.</p>
<p>The LMF may interact with multiple NG-RAN nodes to provide assistance
data information for broadcasting. The assistance data information for
broadcast may optionally be segmented and/or ciphered by the LMF. The
LMF may also interact with AMFs to provide ciphering key data
information to the AMF as described in greater detail in TS 23.273
[35].</p>
<p>For positioning of a target UE, the LMF decides on the position
methods to be used, based on factors that may include the LCS Client
type, the required QoS, UE positioning capabilities, gNB positioning
capabilities and ng-eNB positioning capabilities. The LMF then invokes
these positioning methods in the UE, serving gNB and/or serving ng‑eNB.
The positioning methods may yield a location estimate for UE-based
position methods and/or positioning measurements for UE-assisted and
network-based position methods. The LMF may combine all the received
results and determine a single location estimate for the target UE
(hybrid positioning). Additional information like accuracy of the
location estimate and velocity may also be determined.</p>
<p>The LMF may interact with the AMF to provide (updated) UE Positioning
Capability to AMF and to receive stored UE Positioning Capability from
AMF as described in TS 23.273 [35].</p>
<h3 id="positioning-reference-unit-pru">5.4.5 Positioning Reference Unit
(PRU)</h3>
<p>A Positioning Reference Unit (PRU) at a known location can perform
positioning measurements (e.g., RSTD, RSRP, UE Rx-Tx Time Difference
measurements, etc.) and report these measurements to a location server.
In addition, the PRU can transmit SRS to enable TRPs to measure and
report UL positioning measurements (e.g., RTOA, UL-AoA, gNB Rx-Tx Time
Difference, etc.) from PRU at a known location. The PRU measurements can
be compared by a location server with the measurements expected at the
known PRU location to determine correction terms for other nearby target
devices. The DL- and/or UL location measurements for other target
devices can then be corrected based on the previously determined
correction terms.</p>
<p>From a location server perspective, the PRU functionality is realized
by a UE with known location.</p>

<h3 id="ng-c-interface">6.1.4 NG-C interface</h3>
<p>The NG-C interface between the gNB and the AMF and between the ng-eNB
and the AMF is transparent to all UE-positioning-related procedures. It
is involved in these procedures only as a transport link for the NR
positioning protocol(s).</p>
<p>For gNB related positioning procedures, the NG-C interface
transparently transports both positioning requests from the LMF to the
gNB and positioning results from the gNB to the LMF.</p>
<p>For ng-eNB related positioning procedures, the NG-C interface
transparently transports both positioning requests from the LMF to the
ng-eNB and positioning results from the ng-eNB to the LMF.</p>
<p>For delivery of broadcast assistance data information, the NG-C
interface transparently transports both the assistance data information
from the LMF to the NG-RAN node for broadcasting and the feedback
information on assistance information broadcasting from the NG-RAN node
to the LMF. The NG-C interface is also used by an AMF to transparently
transport ciphering keys via NG-RAN node to UEs using a NAS message. The
ciphering keys are used to decipher broadcast assistance data
information, if the broadcast assistance data information is
ciphered.</p>

<h2 id="ue-terminated-protocols">6.2 UE-terminated protocols</h2>
<h3 id="lte-positioning-protocol-lpp">6.2.1 LTE Positioning Protocol
(LPP)</h3>
<p>The LTE Positioning Protocol (LPP) is terminated between a target
device (the UE in the control-plane case or SET in the user-plane case)
and a positioning server (the LMF in the control-plane case or SLP in
the user-plane case). It may use either the control- or user-plane
protocols as underlying transport. In this specification, only control
plane use of LPP is defined. User plane support of LPP is defined in
[15] and [16].</p>
<p>LPP messages are carried as transparent PDUs across intermediate
network interfaces using the appropriate protocols (e.g., NGAP over the
NG-C interface, NAS/RRC over the LTE-Uu and NR-Uu interfaces). The LPP
protocol is intended to enable positioning for NR and LTE using a
multiplicity of different position methods, while isolating the details
of any particular positioning method and the specifics of the underlying
transport from one another.</p>
<p>The protocol operates on a transaction basis between a target device
and a server, with each transaction taking place as an independent
procedure. More than one such procedure may be in progress at any given
moment. An LPP procedure may involve a request/response pairing of
messages or one or more "unsolicited" messages. Each procedure has a
single objective (e.g., transfer of assistance data, exchange of LPP
related capabilities, or positioning of a target device according to
some QoS and use of one or more positioning methods). Multiple
procedures, in series and/or in parallel, can be used to achieve more
complex objectives (e.g., positioning of a target device in association
with transfer of assistance data and exchange of LPP related
capabilities). Multiple procedures also enable more than one positioning
attempt to be ongoing at the same time (e.g., to obtain a coarse
location estimate with low delay while a more accurate location estimate
is being obtained with higher delay).</p>
<p>An LPP session is defined between a positioning server and the target
device, the details of its relation with transactions are described in
clause 4.1.2 of TS 36.355 [19].</p>
<p>For the 3GPP 5GS Control Plane solution defined in TS 23.501 [2], TS
23.502 [26] and TS 23.273 [35], the UE is the target device and the LMF
is the server. For SUPL 2.0 support, the SUPL Enabled Terminal (SET) is
the target device and the SUPL Location Platform (SLP) is the server.
The operations controlled through LPP are described further in clause
7.1.</p>
<p>LPP defined data structures for assistance data information are
reused for supporting RRC broadcast of assistance data information which
are embedded in positioning SIBs. This enables broadcast assistance data
using the same data structures which are used for point to point
location.</p>

<p>1. Steps 1 to 4 may occur before, after, or at the same time as steps
5 to 8. Steps 1 to 4 and steps 5 to 8 may also be repeated. Steps 1 to 4

part of some LPP positioning activity. The LMF then invokes the
Namf_Communication _N1N2MessageTransfer service operation towards the
AMF to request the transfer of a LPP PDU to the UE. The service
operation includes the LPP PDU together with the LCS Correlation ID in

<p>As described in clause 6.2.1, the protocol operates between a

<p>3. The LMF may determine the assistance data required for the
selected position method or methods, and sends them in one or more LPP
Provide Assistance data messages to the UE, as described in clause
7.1.2.2. If an LPP acknowledgement was requested, the UE sends an LPP

intra-frequency neighbour cells and for inter-frequency neighbour cells.
The UE may use inter-frequency information in system information of the
serving cell specified in TS 36.331 [13] to decide on which
inter-frequency cells to measure.</p>
<p>5. The UE sends an LPP acknowledgement for each received LPP Request
Location Information message to the LMF, if an LPP acknowledgement was
requested at step 4 but does not perform the requested measurements.</p>
<p>6. The UE may finish any other activities in progress (e.g., SMS or
data transfer), and waits until the network releases or suspends the
connection (after a certain period of inactivity). The UE will then
receive an RRC connection release or suspend from the ng-eNB due to the
expiration of the inactivity timer.</p>
<p>7. When the UE has entered RRC_IDLE state, the UE performs the
measurements requested in step 4.</p>
<p>8. Before the location measurements are to be sent to the LMF, the UE
instigates a UE-triggered service request or, when User Plane CIoT 5GC
optimization applies, the Connection Resume procedure as defined in TS
23.501 [2], if the UE is not using Control Plane CIoT 5GC Optimisation,
in order to establish a signalling connection with the AMF. If the UE is
using Control Plane CIoT 5GC Optimisation, procedures for Mobile
Originated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GC optimisation as
defined in TS 23.501 [2] are performed by the UE to establish a
signalling connection with the AMF.</p>
<p>9. When the LPP response time received in step 4 expires (or when
location measurements are available before expiry), the UE sends one or
more LPP Provide Location Information messages containing the requested
location measurements or location estimate obtained in step 7 to the
LMF.</p>
<h2 id="general-nrppa-procedures-for-ue-positioning">7.2 General NRPPa
Procedures for UE Positioning</h2>
<h3 id="nrppa-procedures">7.2.1 NRPPa procedures</h3>
<p>Positioning and data acquisition transactions between a LMF and
NG-RAN node are modelled by using procedures of the NRPPa protocol.
There are two types of NRPPa procedures:</p>
<p>- UE associated procedure, i.e. transfer of information for a
particular UE, including the procedures supporting the Positioning
Information Transfer, E-CID Location Information Transfer and
Measurement Preconfiguration Information Transfer functions;</p>
<p>- Non UE associated procedure, i.e. transfer of information
applicable to the NG-RAN node and associated TRP, including the
procedures supporting the OTDOA Information Transfer, Assistance
Information Transfer, TRP Information Transfer, Measurement Information
Transfer and PRS Information Transfer functions.</p>
<p>Parallel transactions between the same LMF and NG-RAN node are
supported; i.e. a pair of LMF and NG-RAN node may have more than one
instance of an NRPPa procedure in execution at the same time.</p>
<p>For possible extensibility, the protocol is considered to operate
between a generic "access node" (e.g. gNB, ng-eNB) and a "server" (e.g.
LMF). An NRPPa transaction is only initiated by the server.</p>
<p><img src="media/image14.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 7.2.1-1: A single NRPPa transaction</p>
<p>Figure 7.2.1-1 shows a single NRPPa transaction. The transaction is
terminated in step 2 in procedures including OTDOA Information Exchange,
TRP Information Exchange, PRS Configuration Exchange and Measurement
Preconfiguration. For procedures such as Positioning Information
Exchange, Measurement and E-CID Measurement Initiation, additional
responses may be allowed (e.g. sending of updated information
periodically and/or whenever there is some significant change). In this
case, the transaction may be ended after some additional responses. In
the NRPPa protocol, the described transaction may be realized by the
execution of one procedure defined as a request and a response, followed
by one or several procedures initiated by the NG-RAN node (each
procedure defined as a single message) to realize the additional
responses. The Correlation ID, as specified in TS 29.572 [33], included
by the LMF when it invokes the Namf_Communication_N1N2MessageTransfer
AMF service operation to transfer the NRPPa PDU may be used by the LMF
to identify the target UE positioning session.</p>

positioning capabilities when available, as described in TS 23.273
[35].</p>
<p>2. The LMF may obtain location related information from the UE and/or
from the serving NG-RAN Node. In the former case, the LMF instigates one
or more LPP procedures to transfer UE positioning capabilities, provide
assistance data to the UE and/or obtain location information from the
UE. The UE may also instigate one or more LPP procedures after the first
LPP message is received from the LMF (e.g., to request assistance data
from the LMF). If a scheduled location time is provided in step 1, the
LMF may schedule location measurements by the UE to occur at or near to
the scheduled location time. The LPP procedures to transfer UE LPP
positioning capabilities may be skipped if the LMF already obtained the
UE positioning capabilities from the AMF in step 1.</p>
<p>3. If the LMF needs location related information for the UE from the
NG-RAN, the LMF instigates one or more NRPPa procedures. Step 3 is not
necessarily serialised with step 2; if the LMF and NG-RAN Node have the
information to determine what procedures need to take place for the

<p>3. The LMF may obtain location related information from the UE and/or
from the serving NG-RAN node. In the former case or if an immediate
response is needed to any LPP procedure instigated by the UE in step 1
(e.g., a request for assistance data), the LMF instigates one or more
LPP procedures to transfer UE positioning capabilities, provide
assistance data to the UE and/or obtain location information from the
UE. The UE may also instigate further LPP procedures after the first LPP
message is received from the LMF (e.g., to request assistance data or to

</blockquote>
<p>1. If the UE requires measurement gaps for performing the requested
location measurements while measurement gaps are either not configured
or not sufficient, or if the UE needs gaps to acquire the subframe and
slot timing of the target E-UTRA system before requesting measurement
gaps for the inter-RAT RSTD measurements (see TS 38.133 [32], the UE
sends an RRC Location Measurement Indication message to the serving gNB.
The message indicates that the UE is going to start location
measurements, or that the UE is going to acquire subframe and slot
timing of the target E-UTRA system, and includes information required
for the gNB to configure the appropriate measurement gaps. When the gNB
has configured the required measurement gaps the UE performs the
location measurements or timing acquisition procedures.</p>
<p>2. When the UE has completed the location procedures which required
measurement gaps, the UE sends another RRC Location Measurement

has completed the location measurements or timing acquisition
procedures.</p>
<h4 id="ue-positioning-assistance-information">7.4.1.2 UE Positioning

<p>1. The serving gNB may send a RRC Reconfiguration message to the UE,
requesting the UE to provide the association information of UL SRS
resources for positioning with Tx TEGs to the serving gNB if the UE
supports UE Tx TEG reporting. Based on the request from the LMF, the RRC
Reconfiguration message from the serving gNB to the UE indicates the UE
should provide either a single report or a periodic report of UE TxTEG

<p>2. When the UE receives the request via RRC Reconfiguration message,
the UE sends a UE Positioning Assistance Info message to the serving gNB
to report the UE TxTEG information, including all the changes of the UE
TxTEG during the report period if the UE is required to report UE Tx TEG
periodically. The UE will report all the UE TxTEG at the time when the

<p>Positioning assistance data can be included in positioning System
Information Blocks (posSIBs) as described in TS 36.331 [13], TS 38.331
[14] and TS 36.355 [19]. The posSIBs are carried in RRC System
Information (SI) messages. The mapping of posSIBs (assistance data) to
SI messages is flexibly configurable and provided to the UE in SIB1 for
NG-RAN node TS 36.331 [13], TS 38.331 [14].</p>
<p>The UE may request posSI by means of on-demand SI request in
RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and also request posSIBs by means of on-demand SI
request in RRC_CONNECTED as described in TS 38.331 [14].</p>
<p>For each assistance data element, a separate posSIB-type is defined
in TS 36.355 [19]. Each posSIB may be ciphered by the LMF using the
128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm (with counter mode)
as described in TS 36.355 [19], either with the same or different
ciphering key. The posSIBs which exceed the maximum size limit defined

<p><img src="media/image22.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 7.5.2-1: Procedures to support broadcast of assistance
data.</p>
<p>1. The LMF sends an NRPPa Assistance Information Control message to
the NG-RAN node with an indication to start broadcasting assistance
information. The message includes one or more System Information groups,
where each group contains the broadcast periodicity and one or more
posSIB types together with meta data to be scheduled in the same SI
message. Each posSIB type may be ciphered and/or segmented at the LMF.
The meta data may include an indication whether the posSIB type in the
System Information group is ciphered or not, as well as an indication of
an applicable GNSS type.</p>
<p>2. The NG-RAN node includes the received System Information groups in
RRC System Information Messages and corresponding scheduling information
in SIB1 as described in TS 36.331 [13], TS 38.331 [14]. The UE applies
the system information acquisition procedure according to TS 36.331
[13], TS 38.331 [14] for acquiring the assistance data information that
is broadcasted.</p>
<p>3. If the posSIB types were ciphered by the LMF, the LMF invokes the
Nlmf_Broadcast_CipheringKeyData Notify service operation towards the AMF
carrying one or more ciphering keys. For each ciphering key, the LMF
includes a ciphering key value, a ciphering key identifier, a validity
period, a set of applicable tracking areas, and a set of applicable
posSIB types. The AMF may then distribute successfully stored ciphering
keys and their validity times and validity areas to suitably subscribed
UEs using a mobility management message as described in TS 23.273 [35].
The LMF repeats this procedure whenever a ciphering key changes.</p>
<p>4. At any time after Step 1, the NG-RAN node may send a NRPPa
Assistance Information Feedback message to the LMF providing feedback on
assistance information broadcasting. The message may include an
assistance information failure list indicating that certain posSIB types
could not be configured for broadcasting by the NG-RAN node.</p>
<p>5. If the assistance information in a System Information group
changes, the LMF provides updated information in a NRPPa Assistance
Information Control message.</p>
<p>6. The NG-RAN node replaces the previously stored System Information
groups with the new information received at Step 5 and includes the new
System Information groups in RRC System Information Messages.</p>
<p>7. If the LMF wants to abort the broadcast of a System Information
Group, it sends a NRPPa Assistance Information Control message to the
NG-RAN node including an indication to stop broadcasting the assistance
information.</p>

parameters based on pre-defined PRS configuration ID (index-based
request) or explicit parameter requests that is within the scope of the
received pre-defined On-Demand PRS configurations. Otherwise, the UE may
blindly request On-Demand PRS parameters via an explicit request within
the scope of the allowed parameter list, as specified in TS37.355

methods and Supporting Procedures</h1>
<h2 id="gnss-positioning-methods">8.1 GNSS positioning methods</h2>
<h3 id="general-5">8.1.1 General</h3>
<p>A navigation satellite system provides autonomous geo-spatial
positioning with either global or regional coverage. Augmentation
systems, such as SBAS, are navigation satellite systems that provide
regional coverage to augment the navigation systems with global
coverage.</p>
<p>By definition, GNSS refers to satellite constellations that achieve
global coverage, however, in 3GPP specifications the term GNSS is used
to encompass global, regional, and augmentation satellite systems. The
following GNSSs are supported in this version of the specification:</p>
<p>- GPS and its modernization [5], [6], [7]; (global coverage)</p>
<p>- Galileo [8]; (global coverage)</p>
<p>- GLONASS [9]; (global coverage)</p>
<p>- Satellite Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS), including WAAS, EGNOS,
MSAS, and GAGAN [11]; (regional coverage)</p>
<p>- Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) [10]; (regional coverage)</p>
<p>- BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) [20] [34] [44] [45].
(global coverage)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- NAVigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) [43]. (regional
coverage)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each global GNSS can be used individually or in combination with
others, including regional navigation systems and augmentation systems.
When used in combination, the effective number of navigation satellite
signals would be increased:</p>
<p>- extra satellites can improve availability (of satellites at a
particular location) and results in an improved ability to work in areas
where satellite signals can be obscured, such as in urban canyons;</p>
<p>- extra satellites and signals can improve reliability, i.e., with
extra measurements the data redundancy is increased, which helps
identify any measurement outlier problems;</p>
<p>- extra satellites and signals can improve accuracy due to improved
measurement geometry and improved ranging signals from modernized
satellites.</p>
<p>When GNSS is designed to inter-work with the NG-RAN, the network
assists the UE GNSS receiver to improve the performance in several
respects. These performance improvements will:</p>
<p>- reduce the UE GNSS start-up and acquisition times; the search
window can be limited and the measurements speed up significantly;</p>
<p>- increase the UE GNSS sensitivity; positioning assistance messages
are obtained via NG-RAN so the UE GNSS receiver can operate also in low
SNR situations when it is unable to demodulate GNSS satellite
signals;</p>
<p>- allow the UE to consume less handset power than with stand-alone
GNSS; this is due to rapid start-up times as the GNSS receiver can be in
idle mode when it is not needed;</p>
<p>- allow the UE to compute its position with a better accuracy; RTK
corrections (for N-RTK) and GNSS physical models (for SSR/PPP) are
obtained via NG-RAN so the UE can use these assistance data, together
with its own measurements, i.e., code and carrier phase measurements, to
enable computation of a position with a high accuracy;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- allow the UE to determine and report the integrity results of the
calculated location; the UE can use the integrity requirements and
assistance data obtained via NG-RAN, together with its own measurements,
to determine the integrity results of the calculated location.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The network-assisted GNSS methods rely on signalling between UE GNSS
receivers (possibly with reduced complexity) and a continuously
operating GNSS reference receiver network, which has clear sky
visibility of the same GNSS constellation as the assisted UEs. Two
assisted modes are supported:</p>
<p><em>- UE-Assisted</em>: The UE performs GNSS measurements
(pseudo-ranges, pseudo Doppler, carrier phase ranges, etc.) and sends
these measurements to the LMF where the position calculation takes
place, possibly using additional measurements from other (non GNSS)
sources;</p>
<p><em>- UE-Based</em>: The UE performs GNSS measurements and calculates
its own location, possibly using additional measurements from other (non
GNSS) sources and assistance data from the LMF.</p>
<p>The assistance data content may vary depending on whether the UE
operates in UE-Assisted or UE-Based mode.</p>
<p>The assistance data signalled to the UE can be broadly classified
into:</p>
<p>- <em>data assisting the measurements</em>: e.g. reference time,
visible satellite list, satellite signal Doppler, code phase, Doppler
and code phase search windows;</p>
<p>- <em>data providing means for position calculation</em>: e.g.
reference time, reference position, satellite ephemeris, clock
corrections, code and carrier phase measurements from a GNSS reference
receiver or network of receivers;</p>
<p>- <em>data increasing the position accuracy</em>: e.g. satellite code
biases, satellite orbit corrections, satellite clock corrections,
atmospheric models, RTK residuals, gradients;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <em>data facilitating the integrity results determination of the
calculated location</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A UE with GNSS measurement capability may also operate in an
autonomous (standalone) mode. In autonomous mode the UE determines its
position based on signals received from GNSS without assistance from the
network.</p>
<p>8.1.1a Integrity Principle of Operation</p>
<p>For integrity operation, the network will ensure that:</p>
<p><em>P(Error &gt; Bound for longer than TTA | NOT DNU) &lt;= Residual
Risk + IRallocation</em> (Equation 8.1.1a-1)</p>
<p>for all values of IRallocation in the range irMinimum &lt;=
<em>IRallocation</em> &lt;= irMaximum</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for all the errors in Table 8.1.2.1b-1, which have corresponding
integrity assistance data available and where the corresponding DNU
flag(s) are set to false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The integrity risk probability is decomposed into a constant Residual
Risk component provided in the assistance data as well as a variable
IRallocation component that corresponds to the contribution from the
Bound according to the Bound formula in Equation 8.1.1a-2. IRallocation
may be chosen freely by the client based on the desired Bound, therefore
the network should ensure that Equation 8.1.1a-1 holds for all possible
choices of IRallocation. The Residual Risk and IRallocation components
may be mapped to fault and fault-free cases respectively, but the
implementation is free to choose any other decomposition of the
integrity risk probability into these two components.</p>
<p>The validity time of the integrity bounds is set as equal to twice
the SSR Update Interval for the given SSR Assistance Data message, i.e.
the time period between the SSR Epoch Time and the SSR Epoch Time plus
twice the SSR Update Interval in the GPS time scale.</p>
<p>Equation 8.1.1a-1 holds for all assistance data that has been issued
that is still within its validity period. If this condition cannot be
met then the corresponding DNU flag must be set.</p>
<p>Equation 8.1.1a-1 holds at any epochs for which Assistance Data is
provided. Providing Assistance Data without the Integrity Service Alert
IE or Real Time Integrity IEs is interpreted as a DNU=FALSE condition.
For any bound that is still valid (within its validity time), the
network ensures that the Integrity Service Alert and/or Real Time
Integrity IEs are also included in the provided Assistance Data if
needed to satisfy the condition in Equation 8.1.1a-1. It is up to the
implementation how to handle epochs for which integrity results are
desired but there are no DNU flag(s) available, e.g. the Time To Alert
(TTA) may be set such that there is a "grace period" to receive the next
set of DNU flags.</p>
<p>Only those satellites for which the GNSS integrity assistance data
are provided are monitored by the network and can be used for integrity
related applications.</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Error:</strong> Error is the difference between the true
value of a GNSS parameter (e.g. ionosphere, troposphere etc.), and its
value as estimated and provided in the corresponding assistance data as
per Table 8.1.2.1b-1</p>
<p><strong>Bound:</strong> Integrity Bounds provide the statistical
distribution of the residual errors associated with the GNSS positioning
corrections (e.g. RTK, SSR etc). Integrity bounds are used to
statistically bound the residual errors after the positioning
corrections have been applied. The bound is computed according to the
Bound formula defined in Equation 8.1.1a-2. The bound formula describes
a bounding model including a mean and standard deviation (e.g. paired
over-bounding Gaussian). The bound may be scaled by multiplying the
standard deviation by a K factor corresponding to an IRallocation, for
any desired IRallocation within the permitted range.</p>
<p>Bound for a particular error is computed according to the following
formula:</p>
<p><em>Bound = mean + K * stdDev</em> (Equation 8.1.1a-2)</p>
<p><em>K = normInv(IR<sub>allocation</sub> / 2)</em></p>
<p><em>irMinimum &lt;= IR<sub>allocation</sub> &lt;= irMaximum</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where: <em>mean</em>: mean value for this specific error, as per
Table 8.1.2.1b-1</p>
<p><em>stdDev</em>: standard deviation for this specific error, as per
Table 8.1.2.1b-1</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Time-to-Alert (TTA):</strong> The maximum allowable elapsed
time from when the Error exceeds the Bound until a DNU flag must be
issued.</p>
<p><strong>Target Integrity Risk (TIR):</strong> The probability per
unit of time that the Error exceeds the Bound without issuing a DNU flag
within the TTA.</p>
<p><strong>DNU:</strong> The DNU flag(s) corresponding to a particular
error as per Table 8.1.2.1b-1. Where multiple DNU flags are specified,
the DNU condition in Equation 8.1.1a-1 is present when any of the flags
are true (logical OR of the flags).</p>
<p><strong>Residual Risk:</strong> The residual risk is the component of
the integrity risk provided in the assistance data as per Table
8.1.2.1b-1. This may correspond to the fault case risk but the
implementation is permitted to allocate this component in any way that
satisfies Equation 8.1.1a-1.</p>
<p>The Residual Risk is the Probability of Onset which is defined per
unit of time and represents the probability that the feared event
begins. Each Residual Risk is accompanied by a Mean Duration which
represents the expected mean duration of the corresponding feared event
and is used to convert the Probability of Onset to a probability that
the feared event is present at any given time, i.e.</p>
<p><em>P(Feared Event is Present) = Mean Duration * Probability of Onset
of Feared Event</em> (Equation 8.1.1a-3)</p>
<p><strong>irMinimum, irMaximum:</strong> Minimum and maximum allowable
values of IRallocation that may be chosen by the client. Provided as
service parameters from the Network according to Integrity Service
Parameters.</p>
<p><strong>Correlation Times:</strong> The minimum time interval beyond
which two sets of GNSS assistance data parameters for a given error can
be considered to be independent from one another.</p>

<p>Real-Time Integrity assistance provides the GNSS receiver with
information about the health status of a GNSS constellation (where the

<p>For integrity purposes (as per Clause 8.1.1a), a GNSS satellite and
signal combination should be considered as being marked "Do Not Use"
(DNU) if the satellite ID and signal are present in the list of
unhealthy (bad) signals.</p>
<p>NOTE: The absence of the Real Time Integrity assistance from any
Provide Assistance Data message is interpreted as DNU=FALSE for all

<h5 id="rtk-reference-station-information">8.1.2.1.13 RTK Reference
Station Information</h5>
<p>RTK Reference Station Information provides the GNSS receiver with the
Earth-Centered, Earth-Fixed (ECEF) coordinates of the Reference
Station's installed antenna's ARP, and the height of the ARP above the
survey monument. Additionally, this assistance data provides information
about the antenna type installed at the reference site.</p>
<p>NOTE: With the MAC N-RTK technique this assistance data is used to
provide information regarding the Master Reference Station (see clause
8.1.2.1a).</p>
<h5 id="rtk-auxiliary-station-data">8.1.2.1.14 RTK Auxiliary Station
Data</h5>
<p>RTK Auxiliary Station Data provides the GNSS receiver with the
location for all Auxiliary Reference Stations (see clause 8.1.2.1a)
within the assistance data. These values are expressed as relative
geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, and height) with respect to a
Master Reference Station (see clause 8.1.2.1a) and based on the GRS80
ellipsoid. This type of assistance data is relevant only with the MAC
N-RTK technique [31].</p>
<h5 id="rtk-observations">8.1.2.1.15 RTK Observations</h5>
<p>RTK Observations provides the GNSS receiver with all primary
observables (pseudo-range, phase-range, phase-range rate (Doppler), and
carrier-to-noise ratio) generated at the Reference Station for each GNSS
signal. The signal generation from the reference station is in
compliance with [31]: as an example, the phase measurements of different
signals in the same band must be phased aligned. More examples can be
found in [31].</p>
<p>The pseudo-range is the distance between the satellite and GNSS
receiver antennas, expressed in metres, equivalent to the difference of
the time of reception (expressed in the time frame of the GNSS receiver)
and the time of transmission (expressed in the time frame of the
satellite) of a distinct satellite signal.</p>
<p>The phase-range measurement is a measurement of the range between a
satellite and receiver expressed in units of cycles of the carrier
frequency. This measurement is more precise than the pseudo-range (of
the order of millimetres), but it is ambiguous by an unknown integer
number of wavelengths.</p>
<p>The phase-range rate is the rate at which the phase-range between a
satellite and a GNSS receiver changes over a particular period of
time.</p>
<p>The carrier-to-noise ratio is the ratio of the received modulated
carrier signal power to the noise power after the GNSS receiver
filters.</p>
<p>NOTE: With the MAC N-RTK technique this assistance data is used to
provide raw observables recorded at the Master Reference Station (see
clause 8.1.2.1a).</p>
<h5 id="rtk-common-observation-information">8.1.2.1.16 RTK Common
Observation Information</h5>
<p>RTK Common Observation Information provides the GNSS receiver with
common information applicable to any GNSS, e.g. clock steering
indicator. This assistance data is always used together GNSS RTK
Observations (see clause 8.1.2.1.15).</p>
<h5 id="glonass-rtk-bias-information">8.1.2.1.17 GLONASS RTK Bias
Information</h5>
<p>RTK Bias Information provides the GNSS receiver with information
which is intended to compensate for the first-order inter-frequency
phase-range biases introduced by the reference receiver code-phase
biases. This information is applicable only for GLONASS FDMA signals. In
the case that the MAC Network RTK method is used, GLONASS RTK Bias
Information defines the code-phase biases related to the Master
Reference Station [31].</p>
<h5 id="rtk-mac-correction-differences">8.1.2.1.18 RTK MAC Correction
Differences</h5>
<p>RTK MAC Correction Differences provides the GNSS receiver with
information about ionospheric (dispersive) and geometric
(non-dispersive) corrections generated between a Master Reference
Station and its Auxiliary Reference Stations [31].</p>
<h5 id="rtk-residuals">8.1.2.1.19 RTK Residuals</h5>
<p>RTK Residuals provides the GNSS receiver with network error models
generated for the interpolated corrections disseminated in Network RTK
techniques. With sufficient redundancy in the RTK network, the location
server process can provide an estimate for residual interpolation
errors. Such quality estimates may be used by the target UE to optimize
the performance of RTK solutions. The values may be considered by the
target UE as a priori estimates only, with sufficient tracking data
available the target UE might be able to judge residual geometric and
ionospheric errors itself. According to [31], RTK Residual error
information should be transmitted every 10-60 seconds.</p>
<h5 id="rtk-fkp-gradients">8.1.2.1.20 RTK FKP Gradients</h5>
<p>RTK FKP Gradients provides the GNSS receiver with horizontal
gradients for the geometric (troposphere and satellite orbits) and
ionospheric signal components in the observation space. According to
[31], RTK FKP gradient information should be typically transmitted every
10-60 seconds.</p>
<h5 id="ssr-orbit-corrections">8.1.2.1.21 SSR Orbit Corrections</h5>
<p>SSR Orbit Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with parameters for
orbit corrections in radial, along-track and cross-track components.
These orbit corrections are used to compute a satellite position
correction, to be combined with satellite position <sup>­</sup>calculated
from broadcast ephemeris (see clause 8.1.2.1.7).</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The orbit corrections define an offset between the broadcast
ephemeris orbit and a satellite antenna reference point (ARP) to which
the other corrections refer. The exact definition of the reference point
along the satellite antenna is implementation-defined by the Network and
use of all corrections together shall yield a consistent solution.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The UE should not apply any additional corrections for the
Satellite Antenna Phase Center (APC) such as Phase Center Offset (PCO)
or Phase Center Variation (PCV) corrections. The Network may form the
SSR corrections to minimise the impact of Satellite APC effects on the
UE.</p>
<p>For integrity purposes, SSR Orbit Corrections also provides the
correlation time for orbit error and orbit error rate, and the mean and
standard deviation that bounds the residual Orbit Error and its
associated error rate. The SSR Orbit Corrections also includes the
satellite and constellation residual risks. These residual risks are the
aggregate residual risk for the satellite or constellation Signal in
Space including Orbit, Clock, Bias and all other satellite or
constellation feared events, but excluding atmospheric effects.</p>
<p>When applying the integrity bounds as per 8.1.1a, the mean and stdDev
must be calculated by projecting the Orbit error mean and variance along
the line-of-sight vector between the satellite and the user, according
to the following formula:</p>
<blockquote>

<h5 id="ssr-clock-corrections">8.1.2.1.22 SSR Clock Corrections</h5>
<p>SSR Clock Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with parameters to
compute the GNSS satellite clock correction applied to the broadcast
satellite clock (see clause 8.1.2.1.7). A polynomial of order 2
describes the clock differences for a certain time period: clock offset,
drift, and drift rate.</p>
<p>For integrity purposes, SSR Clock Corrections also provides the
correlation time for clock error and clock error rate, and the mean and
standard deviation that bounds the residual Clock Error and its
associated error rate.</p>
<h5 id="ssr-code-bias">8.1.2.1.23 SSR Code Bias</h5>
<p>SSR Code Bias provides the GNSS receiver with the Code Biases that
must be added to the pseudo range measurements of the corresponding code
signal to get corrected pseudo ranges. SSR Code Bias contains absolute
values, but also enables the alternative use of Differential Code Biases
by setting one of the biases to zero. A UE can consistently use signals
for which a code bias is transmitted. It is not reliable for a UE to use
a signal without retrieving a corresponding code bias from the
assistance data message.</p>
<p>For integrity purposes, SSR Code Bias also provides the mean and
standard deviation that bounds the residual Code Bias Error and its
associated error rate.</p>
<h5 id="ssr-phase-bias">8.1.2.1.24 SSR Phase Bias</h5>
<p>SSR Phase Bias provides the GNSS receiver with the GNSS signal phase
bias that are added to the carrier phase measurements of the
corresponding signal to get corrected phase ranges. An indicator used to
count events when phase bias is discontinuous is provided. An optional
indicator is also provided to indicate whether fixed, widelane fixed or
float PPP-RTK positioning modes are supported on a per signal basis.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: On the UE side, phase bias corrections of appropriate type
are needed to restore the integer nature of the phase ambiguities in
PPP-RTK. Their absence will affect the quality of the positioning
solution and prevent a fast convergence time.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: PPP-RTK Fixed position mode corresponds to the UE fixing the
carrier phase ambiguity to an integer value. The PPP-RTK Widelane Fixed
positioning mode corresponds to forming the widelane combination of
carrier phase measurements and fixing the resulting ambiguity as an
integer value. In PPP-RTK Float positioning mode the carrier phase
ambiguity is not treated as an integer value.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: The SSR Phase Bias values must be consistent with a satellite
yaw angle of zero as per [36].</p>
<p>For integrity purposes, SSR Phase Bias also provides the mean and
standard deviation that bounds the residual Phase Bias Error and its
associated error rate.</p>
<h5 id="ssr-stec-corrections">8.1.2.1.25 SSR STEC Corrections</h5>
<p>SSR STEC Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with the parameters
to compute the ionosphere slant delay correction based on a variable
order polynomial on a per satellite basis and applied to the code and
phase measurements.</p>
<p>For integrity purposes, SSR STEC Corrections also provides the
ionosphere residual risk parameters, correlation time for ionosposphere
range error and range error rate, and the mean and standard deviation
that bounds the residual Ionospheric Error and its associated error
rate.</p>
<h5 id="ssr-gridded-correction">8.1.2.1.26 SSR Gridded Correction</h5>
<p>SSR Gridded Corrections provides the GNSS receiver with STEC
residuals and Troposphere delays at a series of correction points and
expressed as hydrostatic and wet vertical delays.</p>
<p>NOTE: The final ionosphere slant delay (STEC) consists of the
polynomial part provided in SSR STEC Correction and the residual part
provided in SSR Gridded Corrections.</p>
<p>For integrity purposes, SSR Gridded Corrections also provides the
troposphere residual risk parameters, correlation time for troposphere
range error and range error rate, and the mean and standard deviation
that bounds the residual Tropospheric Error and associated its error
rate in the Vertical Hydro Static Delay and Vertical Wet Delay
components.</p>
<h5 id="ssr-ura">8.1.2.1.27 SSR URA</h5>
<p>SSR URA provides the receiver with information about the estimated
accuracy of the corrections for each satellite.</p>
<h5 id="ssr-correction-points">8.1.2.1.28 SSR Correction Points</h5>
<p>The SSR Correction Points provides a list of correction point
coordinates or an array of correction points ("grid") for which the SSR
Gridded Corrections are valid.</p>
<h5 id="integrity-service-parameters">8.1.2.1.29 Integrity Service
Parameters</h5>
<p>Integrity Service Parameters provide the range of Integrity Risk (IR)
for which the associated GNSS integrity assistance data is considered to
be valid.</p>
<h5 id="integrity-alerts">8.1.2.1.30 Integrity Alerts</h5>
<p>Integrity Service Alerts provide information on whether the service
can be used for integrity. A Do Not Use (DNU) flag indicates that the
corresponding assistance data is not suitable for the purpose of
computing integrity. If an Integrity Service Alert is issued and the DNU
flag is false, then the corresponding assistance data may be used for
the purpose of computing integrity. The DNU flags are defined to be
applicable to the specified epoch time only.</p>

Recommendations for grouping of assistance data to support different RTK
service levels</h4>
<p>This clause provides recommendations for the different high-accuracy
GNSS service levels: RTK, N-RTK, PPP and PPP-RTK.</p>
<p>The high-accuracy GNSS methods can be classified as:</p>
<p>- <em>Single base RTK service</em>: RTK is a technique that uses
carrier-based ranging measurements i.e., phase-range to improve the
positioning accuracy in a differential approach. The basic concept is to
reduce and remove errors common to a Reference Station, with known
position, and UE pair. When only pseudo ranges (code-based measurements)
are used to compute the UE location, this method is known as DGNSS
(Differential GNSS).</p>

message)</td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>- <em>Non-Physical Reference Station Network RTK service</em>: In
this approach the target UE receives synthetic observations from a
fictitious Reference Station. The Network RTK software at the location
server is performing the error estimation and creates a virtual
Reference Station close to the initial location of the target device
(provided a priori to the location server). The target UE interprets and
uses the data just as if it had come from a single, real Reference
Station. Additionally, the target UE can also receive network
information such as RTK Network Residuals (see clause 8.1.2.1.19) or
even FKP gradients (see clause 8.1.2.1.20).</p>

</table>
<p>- <em>MAC Network RTK service</em>: In MAC network RTK, a group of
Reference Stations are used and one of them is chosen as a Master
station. The other stations are then called Auxiliary stations. In this
service, the location server sends full raw observations and coordinate
information for a single Reference Station, the Master Station. For all
auxiliary stations in the network (or a suitable subset of stations) the
information is provided to the UE in a highly compact form: their
reduced ambiguity-levelled observations, coordinate differences (to the
Master Station observations and coordinates), and network residuals. Two
Reference Stations are said to be on a common ambiguity level if the
integer ambiguities for each phase range (satellite-receiver pair) have
been removed (or adjusted) so that the integer ambiguities cancel when
double-differences (involving two receivers and two satellites) are
formed during processing. The maintenance of a common ambiguity level at
a specific set of stations rather than across the whole GNSS network
will lead to a grouping in network clusters or subnetworks of all
ambiguity-levelled Reference Stations. If one network has only one
subnetwork, this indicates that an ambiguity level throughout the whole
network is established. When subnetworks are predefined, the assistance
data can be broadcast to all UEs located in the assigned sub-network.
More details on the usage of subnetworks can be found in [31].</p>

<p>- <em>FKP Network RTK service</em>: With the concept of FKP,
horizontal gradients of distance-dependent errors like ionosphere,
troposphere and orbits are derived from a network of GNSS Reference
Stations and transmitted to a target device together with raw or
correction data of a corresponding Reference Station (physical or non
physical). The target UE may use the gradients to compute the effect of
the distance-dependent errors for its own position.</p>

<p>- <em>PPP service</em>: This concept uses precise satellite orbit and
clock parameters derived from global networks of Reference Stations as
well as atmospheric models to perform single station positioning [31].
Compared to RTK and Network RTK, PPP is not a differential technique as
there is no baseline limitation. When the orbits and clocks assistance
data elements are provided in real-time, with no latency, the method is
called Real-Time PPP.</p>

<p>- <em>PPP-RTK service</em>: This concept uses precise satellite
orbits and clock parameters, the satellite signal biases derived from
global networks of Reference Stations as well as ionosphere and
troposphere corrections to perform single station positioning
IS-QZSS-L6-001 [36]. Therefore, PPP-RTK services compensate the global
and local corrections for a more accurate location information. Compared
to PPP, PPP-RTK requires the UE to be located within the region covered
by the ionosphere and troposphere corrections.</p>

<p>(3) The LMF may continue to send further LPP Provide Assistance Data
messages to the target containing the periodic assistance data announced
in step (1) when each additional periodicity condition occurs. When the

<p>(1) The UE determines that certain A-GNSS assistance data are desired
(e.g., as part of a positioning procedure when the LMF provided
assistance data are not sufficient for the UE to fulfil the request) and
sends a LPP Request Assistance Data message to the LMF. This request
includes an indication of which specific A-GNSS assistance data are
requested for each GNSS, possibly together with additional information
(e.g., for which GNSS signal types, or satellites, or times the
assistance is requested, etc.). Additional information concerning the
UE's approximate location and serving and neighbour cells may also be
provided in the Request Assistance Data message and/or in an
accompanying Provide Location Information message to help the LMF
provide appropriate assistance data. This additional data may include
the UE's last known location if available, the cell IDs of the UE
serving NG-RAN node and possibly neighbour NG-RAN nodes, as well as
E-UTRA E-CID measurements.</p>
<p>(2) The LMF provides the requested assistance data in a LPP Provide
Assistance Data message, if available at the LMF. The entire set of
assistance data may be delivered in one or several LPP messages, e.g.,
one message per GNSS. In this case, this step may be repeated by the LMF
several times. If any of the UE requested assistance data in step (1)
are not provided in step 2, the UE shall assume that the requested
assistance data are not supported, or currently not available at the

sending the assistance data and a duration for ending the periodic
assistance data delivery session.</p>
<p>(2) The LMF responds with a LPP Provide Assistance Data message to
the UE. If the UE request can be supported, the message contains
information which may confirm or redefine the type of assistance data or
periodicity parameters requested at step (1). This response indicates
the end of the control transaction.</p>
<p>(3) When available, the LMF provides the requested assistance data in
a LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the UE. If any of the requested
assistance data in step (1) or redefined in step (2) are not provided
the UE assumes that the requested assistance data are not supported, or
currently not available at the LMF.</p>
<p>(4) The LMF may transmit one or more additional LPP Provide
Assistance Data messages to the UE containing further periodic
assistance data confirmed or redefined in step (2). When the duration
for ending the periodic assistance data transfer occur, the last LPP
Provide Assistance Data message transferred indicates the end of the
transaction. Additionally, the periodic assistance data delivery session
can be ended on request by the UE or by the LMF with the help of an
Abort message.</p>

<p><img src="media/image32.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.1.3.3.1-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer
Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends a LPP Request Location Information message to the
UE for invocation of A-GNSS positioning. This request includes
positioning instructions such as the GNSS mode (UE-assisted, UE-based,
UE-based preferred but UE-assisted allowed, UE-assisted preferred, but
UE-based allowed, standalone), positioning methods (GPS, Galileo,
GLONASS, BDS, NavIC, etc. and possibly non-GNSS methods, such as OTDOA
positioning or E-CID positioning), specific UE measurements requested if
any, such as fine time assistance measurements, velocity, carrier phase,
multi-frequency measurements, quality of service parameters (accuracy,
response time), and possibly integrity requirements.</p>
<p>(2) The UE performs the requested measurements and possibly
calculates its own location. The UE may also determine the integrity
results of the calculated location. The UE sends an LPP Provide Location
Information message to the LMF before the Response Time provided in step
(1) elapsed. If the UE is unable to perform the requested measurements,
or if the Response Time provided in step 1 elapsed before any of the
requested measurements have been obtained, the UE returns any
information that can be provided in an LPP message of type Provide
Location Information which includes a cause indication for the not
provided location information.</p>

<h2 id="otdoa-positioning-1">8.2 OTDOA positioning</h2>
<h3 id="general-6">8.2.1 General</h3>
<p>In this version of the specification, only OTDOA based on LTE signals
is supported.</p>
<p>In the OTDOA positioning method, the UE position is estimated based
on measurements taken at the UE of downlink radio signals from multiple
E-UTRA TPs (possibly including PRS-only E-UTRA TPs from a PRS-based
TBS), along with knowledge of the geographical coordinates of the
measured TPs and their relative downlink timing.</p>
<p>The UE while connected to a gNB may require measurement gaps to
perform the OTDOA measurements from E-UTRA TPs. The UE may request
measurement gaps from a gNB using the procedure described in clause
7.4.1.1. If the UE is not aware of the SFN of at least one E-UTRA TP in
the OTDOA assistance data, the UE may use autonomous gaps to acquire SFN
of the E-UTRA OTDOA reference cell prior to requesting measurement gaps
for performing the requested E-UTRA RSTD measurements.</p>
<p>The UE while connected to a ng-eNB may require measurement gaps to
perform inter-frequency RSTD measurements for OTDOA from E-UTRA TPs (see
TS 38.133 [32]). The UE may request measurement gaps from a ng-eNB using
the procedure described in clause 7.4.2.1.</p>
<p>The specific positioning techniques used to estimate the UE's
location from this information are beyond the scope of this
specification.</p>

<h3 id="general-7">8.3.1 General</h3>
<p>In the Cell ID (CID) positioning method, the UE position is estimated
with the knowledge of the geographical coordinates of its serving ng-eNB
or gNB.</p>
<p>Enhanced Cell ID (E-CID) based on LTE signals positioning refers to
techniques which use UE and/or NG-RAN radio resource related
measurements to improve the UE location estimate. In the case of a
serving ng-eNB, uplink E-CID may use inter-RAT NR, GERAN, UTRA or WLAN
measurements reported by UE.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: For E-CID positioning methods the UE reports only the
measurements that it has available rather than being required to take
additional measurement actions. Therefore, the measurement gap request
procedure described in clause 7.4.1.1 is not applicable for E-CID
positioning methods.</p>
<p>E-CID measurements for E-UTRA may include [17, 18]:</p>
<p>UE measurements (TS 36.214 [17], TS 36.302 [18]):</p>
<p>- E-UTRA Reference signal received power (RSRP);</p>
<p>- E-UTRA Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ);</p>
<p>- UE E-UTRA Rx – Tx time difference;</p>

<p>- UTRAN CPICH RSCP;</p>
<p>- UTRAN CPICH Ec/Io;</p>
<p>- WLAN RSSI.</p>
<p>- SS Reference signal received power (SS-RSRP);</p>
<p>- SS Reference Signal Received Quality (SS-RSRQ);</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The above GERAN, UTRAN, WLAN and NR measurements by UE are
only used for Uplink E-CID positioning.</p>
<p>ng-eNB measurements (TS 36.214 [17], TS 36.302 [18]):</p>

<p>(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION REQUEST
message to the NG-RAN node. This request includes indication of E-CID
measurements requested and whether the result is expected only once or
periodically.</p>
<p>(2) If the LMF in step (1) requested UE measurements (e.g., E-UTRA
RSRP, E-UTRA RSRQ measurements, etc.), the NG-RAN node may configure the
UE to report the measurement information requested as specified in TS
36.331 [13], TS 38.331 [14].</p>
<p>(3) If the result is expected only once and the NG-RAN node initiates
at least one of the E-CID measurements as requested, the NG-RAN node
sends an NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE to the LMF, which
includes the obtained E-CID measurements. If the result is expected
periodically and the NG-RAN node is able to initiate at least one of the
E-CID measurements as requested, the NG-RAN node sends an NRPPa E-CID
MEASUREMENT INITIATION RESPONSE to the LMF, which does not include any
result. The NG-RAN node reports then the obtained measurements by
initiating the E-CID Measurement Report procedure, with the requested
periodicity. If the NG-RAN node is unable to initiate any of the
requested measurements as requested from the LMF, or is unable to
instigate any of the required RRC procedures to obtain the requested
measurements from the UE, the NG-RAN node sends an NRPPa E-CID
MEASUREMENT INITIATION FAILURE message providing the error reason. If
the failure occurs during a periodic reporting, the NG-RAN node sends an
NRPPa E-CID MEASUREMENT FAILURE INDICATION message.</p>
<h2 id="barometric-pressure-sensor-positioning-1">8.4 Barometric
pressure sensor positioning</h2>
<p>8.4.1 General</p>
<p>In the barometric pressure sensor positioning method, the UE vertical
component of the position is estimated by combining the measured
atmospheric pressure and a reference atmospheric pressure. This is
accomplished through barometric sensors measuring atmospheric pressure
at the UE, and applying a height determination algorithm using the
reference atmospheric pressure.</p>
<p>Three positioning modes are supported:</p>
<p>- <em>UE-Assisted</em>: The UE performs barometric pressure sensor
measurements with or without assistance from the network and sends these
measurements to the LMF where the vertical component of the position
calculation may take place, possibly using additional measurements from
other sources;</p>
<p>- <em>UE-Based</em>: The UE performs barometric pressure sensor
measurements and calculates its own vertical component of the position,
possibly using additional measurements from other sources.</p>
<p>- <em>Standalone</em>: The UE performs barometric pressure sensor
measurements and calculates its own vertical component of the position,
possibly using additional measurements from other sources, without
network assistance.</p>

<h3 id="general-9">8.7.1 General</h3>
<p>Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS) is the standard generic term for a
network of ground-based transmitters broadcasting signals for
geo-spatial positioning with wide-area or regional coverage. The
following TBSs are supported in this version of the specification:</p>
<p>- Metropolitan Beacon Systems (MBS).</p>
<p>NOTE: PRS-based TBS is part of downlink OTDOA positioning and
described in clause 8.2.</p>
<p>Three positioning modes are supported:</p>
<p>- <em>UE-Assisted</em>: The UE performs TBS measurements with or
without assistance from the network, and sends these measurements to the
LMF where the position calculation takes place, possibly using
additional measurements from other (non-TBS) sources;</p>
<p>- <em>UE-Based</em>: The UE performs TBS measurements and calculates
its own location, possibly using additional measurements from other
(non-TBS) sources.</p>
<p>- <em>Standalone</em>: The UE performs TBS measurements and
calculates its own location, possibly using additional measurements from
other (non-TBS) sources, without network assistance.</p>

positioning methods</h2>
<h3 id="general-13">8.9.1 General</h3>
<p>NR Enhanced Cell ID (NR E-CID) positioning refers to techniques which
use UE and/or NR radio resource related measurements to improve the UE
location estimate. In the case of uplink NR E-CID inter-RAT E-UTRA
measurements reported by UE may also be used.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: For NR E-CID positioning methods the UE reports only the
measurements that it has available rather than being required to take
additional measurement actions. Therefore, the measurement gap request
procedure described in clause 7.4.1.1 is not applicable for NR E-CID
positioning methods.</p>
<p>NR E-CID measurements may include:</p>
<p>UE measurements (TS 38.215 [37]):</p>
<p>- SS Reference signal received power (SS-RSRP);</p>
<p>- SS Reference Signal Received Quality (SS-RSRQ);</p>
<p>- CSI Reference signal received power (CSI-RSRP);</p>
<p>- CSI Reference Signal Received Quality (CSI-RSRQ).</p>
<p>The UE measurements above may be aggregated at cell level or measured
per SSB or CSI-RS resource.</p>
<p>NR E-CID UE measurements for other RAT may include:</p>
<p>- E-UTRA Reference signal received power (RSRP);</p>
<p>- E-UTRA Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ);</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The above E-UTRA measurements by UE are only used for Uplink
NR E-CID positioning.</p>
<p>gNB measurements (TS 38.215 [37]):</p>
<p>- UL Angle of Arrival (azimuth and elevation);</p>

perform this procedure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image42.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.9.4.3-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer
Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends an E-CID Measurement Initiation Request message to
the serving gNB to request NR E-CID measurement information. The message
includes indication of NR E-CID measurements requested and whether the
result is expected only once or periodically.</p>
<p>(2) If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to "on demand",
the gNB obtains the requested NR E-CID measurements and returns them in
an E-CID Measurement Initiation Response message to the LMF. The E-CID
Measurement Initiation Response message includes the obtained NR E-CID
measurements as defined in the clause 8.9.2.3.</p>
<p>If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to "periodic", the gNB
replies with an E-CID Measurement Initiation Response message without
including any measurements in the message. The gNB then periodically
initiates the E-CID Measurement Report procedure in step 3 for the NR
E-CID measurements, with the requested reporting periodicity.<br />
<br />
If the gNB is not able to accept the E-CID Measurement Initiation
Request message in step 1, the gNB returns a failure message indicating
the cause of the failure.</p>
<p>(3) The gNB periodically provides the NR E-CID measurements as
defined in the clause 8.9.2.3 to the LMF if that was requested at step
1.</p>
<p>(4) If the previously requested NR E-CID measurements can no longer
be reported, the gNB notifies the LMF by sending an E-CID Measurement
Failure Indication message.</p>
<p>(5) When the LMF wants to terminate an ongoing NR E-CID measurement
it sends an E-CID Measurement Termination Command message to the
gNB.</p>

Assistance Data Transfer between LMF and UE</h6>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to provide
assistance data to the UE (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and
the UE to request assistance data from the LMF (e.g., as part of a
positioning procedure). The LMF may provide the pre-configured DL-PRS
assistance data (with associated validity criteria) to the UE (before or
during an ongoing LPP positioning session), to be utilized for potential
positioning measurements at a future time. Pre-configured DL-PRS
assistance data may consist of multiple instances, where each instance
is applicable to a different area within the network. One or more
assistance data instances may be provided. Each instance is provided in
one LPP Assistance Data messages.</p>
<p>If a UE receives assistance data for a TRP for which it has already
stored assistance data, it overwrites the stored assistance data,
whereas if a UE receives assistance data for a TRP for which it has not
stored assistance data, it stores the assistance data for the TRP and
maintains the already stored assistance data for other TRPs. The TRPs
are uniquely identified using a combination of PRS-ID and Cell-ID. The
number TRPs for which the UE can store Assistance Data is a UE
capability and is indicated by the number of areas a UE can support.</p>

provided assistance data are not sufficient for the UE to fulfil the
request) and sends an LPP Request Assistance Data message to the LMF.
This request includes an indication of which specific Multi-RTT
assistance data are requested. Additional information concerning the
UE's approximate location and serving and neighbour cells may also be
provided in the Request Assistance Data message and/or in an
accompanying Provide Location Information message to help the LMF
provide appropriate assistance data. This additional data may include
the UE's last known location if available, the cell IDs of the UE
serving NG-RAN node and possibly neighbour NG-RAN nodes, as well as NR
E-CID measurements.</p>
<p>(2) The LMF provides the requested assistance in an LPP Provide
Assistance Data message, if available at the LMF. If any of the UE
requested assistance data in step (1) are not provided in step 2, the UE
shall assume that the requested assistance data are not supported, or
currently not available at the LMF. If none of the UE requested

Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF determines that certain TRP configuration information is
desired (e.g., as part of a periodic update or as triggered by OAM) and
sends an NRPPa TRP INFORMATION REQUEST message to the gNB. This request
includes an indication of which specific TRP configuration information
is requested.</p>
<p>(2) The gNB provides the requested TRP information in an NRPPa TRP
INFORMATION RESPONSE message, if available at the gNB. If the gNB is not
able to provide any information, it returns an TRP INFORMATION FAILURE
message indicating the cause of the failure.</p>
<p>Figure 8.10.3.2.1-2 shows the UL information Delivery operation from

<p><img src="media/image48.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.10.3.2.1-2: LMF-initiated UL Information Request
Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST to
the serving gNB of the target UE to request UE SRS configuration
information. If the message includes the Requested UL-SRS Transmission
Characteristics as listed in Table 8.10.2.4-1, the gNB should take this
information into account when configuring UL-SRS transmissions for the
UE.</p>
<p>(2) The serving gNB determines the UE SRS configuration to be
allocated for the UE and sends NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION
RESPONSE to the LMF that includes the UE SRS configuration defined in
Table 8.10.2.3-2. If the serving gNB is not able to provide the
requested information, it returns a failure message indicating the cause
of the failure.</p>
<p>(3) If a change has occurred in the UE SRS configuration during the
UE SRS time duration requested at step 1, the gNB sends a POSITIONING
INFORMATION UPDATE message to the LMF. This message contains, in the
case of a change in UE SRS configuration parameters, the UE SRS
configuration information for all cells with UE SRS configured, or an
update in SRS transmission status.</p>
<h5
id="location-information-transferassistance-data-transfer-procedure">8.10.3.2.2
Location Information Transfer/Assistance Data Transfer Procedure</h5>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request
position measurements from a gNB for position calculation of the UE and
also provide necessary assistance data to the gNB.</p>
<p>Figure 8.10.3.2.2-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB
to perform this procedure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image49.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.10.3.2.2-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer
Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message to the selected gNB to request
Multi-RTT measurement information. The message includes any information
required for the gNB to perform the measurements as defined in Table
8.10.2.4-2.</p>
<p>(2) If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to "on demand",
the gNB obtains the requested Multi-RTT measurements and returns them in
a Measurement Response message to the LMF. The Measurement Response
message includes the obtained Multi-RTT measurements as defined in Table
8.10.2.3-3.</p>
<p>If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to "periodic", the gNB
replies with a Measurement Response message without including any
measurements in the message. The gNB then periodically initiates the
Measurement Report procedure in step 3 for the Multi-RTT measurements,
with the requested reporting periodicity.<br />
<br />
If the gNB is not able to accept the Measurement Request message in step
1, the gNB returns a failure message indicating the cause of the
failure.</p>
<p>(3) The gNB periodically provides the Multi-RTT measurements as
defined in Table 8.10.2.3-3. to the LMF if that was requested at step
1.</p>
<p>(4) At any time after step 2, the LMF may send a Measurement Update
message to the gNB providing updated information required for the gNB to
perform the Multi-RTT measurements as defined in Table 8.10.2.4-2. Upon
receiving the message, the gNB overwrites the previously received
measurement configuration information.</p>
<p>(5) If the previously requested Multi-RTT measurements can no longer
be reported, the gNB notifies the LMF by sending a Measurement Failure
Indication message.</p>
<p>(6) When the LMF wants to abort an ongoing Multi-RTT measurement it
sends a Measurement Abort message to the gNB.</p>
<h5 id="positioning-activationdeactivation-procedure">8.10.3.2.3
Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure</h5>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request
activation and deactivation of UL-SRS transmission of the target UE.</p>
<p>Figure 8.10.3.2.3-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB
to perform this procedure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image50.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.10.3.2.3-1: Positioning Activation/Deactivation
Procedure.</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Request message to
the serving gNB of the target UE to request UL-SRS activation for the
target UE. For a semi-persistent UL-SRS, the message includes an
indication of an UL-SRS resource set to be activated and may include
information that indicates the spatial relation for the semi-persistent
UL-SRS resource to be activated, as listed in Table 8.10.2.4-3. For an
aperiodic UL-SRS, the message may include aperiodic SRS Resource trigger
list to indicate the UL-SRS resource to be activated.</p>
<p>(2) For semi-persistent UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the
configured semi-persistent UL-SRS resource sets by sending the SP
Positioning SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE command as specified in
TS 38.321 [39]. For aperiodic UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate
the configured aperiodic UL-SRS resource sets by sending the DCI as
specified in TS 38.212 [40].<br />
If the UL-SRS has been successfully activated as requested in step 1,
the gNB sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to the
LMF. The serving gNB may include a system frame number and a slot number
in the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to the LMF. If the
serving gNB is not able to fulfil the request from step 1, it returns
the Positioning Activation Failure message indicating the cause of the
failure.</p>
<p>(3) If a previously activated UL-SRS should be deactivated, or the
UL-SRS transmission should be released, the LMF sends the NRPPa
Positioning Deactivation message to the serving gNB of the target device
to request deactivation of UL-SRS resource sets, or release all the
UL-SRS resources. This message includes an indication of the UL-SRS
resource set to be deactivated, or an indication of releasing all UL-SRS
resources.</p>

<p>1. The LMF may request the positioning capabilities of the target
device using the LPP Capability Transfer procedure described in clause
8.10.3.1.1.</p>
<p>2. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST message to
the serving gNB to request UL information for the target device as
described in Figure 8.10.3.2.1-2.</p>
<p>3. The serving gNB determines the resources available for UL-SRS and
configures the target device with the UL-SRS resource sets at step
3a.</p>
<p>4. The serving gNB provides the UL-SRS configuration information to
the LMF in a NRPPa POSITIONING INFORMATION RESPONSE message.</p>
<p>NOTE: It is up to implementation on whether SRS configuration is
provided earlier than DL-PRS configuration.</p>
<p>5a. In the case of semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS, the LMF may
request activation of UE SRS transmission by sending a NRPPa Positioning
Activation Request message to the serving gNB of the target device as
described in clause 8.10.3.2.3.</p>
<p>5b. The gNB then activates the UE SRS transmission. The target device
begins the UL-SRS transmission according to the time domain behavior of
UL-SRS resource configuration.</p>
<p>5c. The gNB sends a NRPPa Positioning Activation Response
message.</p>
<p>6. The LMF provides the UL information to the selected gNBs in a
NRPPa MEASUREMENT REQUEST message as described in clause 8.10.3.2.2. The
message includes all information required to enable the gNBs/TRPs to
perform the UL measurements.</p>
<p>7. The LMF sends a LPP Provide Assistance Data message to the target
device as described in clause 8.10.3.1.2.1. The message includes any
required assistance data for the target device to perform the necessary
DL-PRS measurements.</p>
<p>8. The LMF sends a LPP Request Location Information message to
request Multi-RTT measurements.</p>
<p>9a: The target device performs the DL-PRS measurements from all gNBs
provided in the assistance data at step 7.</p>
<p>9b: Each gNB configured at step 6 measures the UE SRS transmissions
from the target device.</p>
<p>10. The target device reports the DL-PRS measurements for Multi-RTT
to the LMF in a LPP Provide Location Information message.</p>
<p>11. Each gNB reports the UE SRS measurements to the LMF in a NRPPa
Measurement Response message as described in clause 8.10.3.2.2.</p>
<p>12. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING DEACTIVATION message to the
serving gNB as described in clause 8.10.3.2.3.</p>
<p>13. The LMF determines the RTTs from the UE and gNB Rx-Tx time
difference measurements for each gNB for which corresponding UL and DL
measurements were provided at steps 10 and 11 and calculates the
position of the target device.</p>

in clause 7.1.2.1.</p>
<h5 id="assistance-data-transfer-procedure-11">8.11.3.1.2 Assistance
Data Transfer Procedure</h5>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to provide
assistance data to the UE (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure) and
the UE to request assistance data from the LMF (e.g., as part of a
positioning procedure). The LMF may provide the pre-configured DL-PRS
assistance data (with associated validity criteria) to the UE (before or
during an ongoing LPP positioning session), to be utilized for potential
positioning measurements at a future time. Pre-configured DL-PRS
assistance data may consist of multiple instances, where each instance
is applicable to a different area within the network. One or more
assistance data instances may be provided. Each instance is provided in
one LPP Assistance Data messages.</p>
<p>If a UE receives assistance data for a TRP for which it has already
stored assistance data, it overwrites the stored assistance data,
whereas if a UE receives assistance data for a TRP for which it has not
stored assistance data, it stores the assistance data for the TRP and
maintains the already stored assistance data for other TRPs. The TRPs
are uniquely identified using a combination of PRS-ID and Cell-ID. The
number TRPs for which the UE can store Assistance Data is a UE
capability and is indicated by the number of areas a UE can support.</p>

<p>(1) The UE determines that certain DL-AoD positioning assistance data
are desired (e.g., as part of a positioning procedure when the LMF
provided assistance data are not sufficient for the UE to fulfil the
request) and sends an LPP Request Assistance Data message to the LMF.
This request includes an indication of which specific DL-AoD assistance
data are requested. Additional information concerning the UE's
approximate location and serving and neighbour cells may also be
provided in the Request Assistance Data message and/or in an
accompanying Provide Location Information message to help the LMF
provide appropriate assistance data. This additional data may include
the UE's last known location if available, the cell IDs of the UE
serving NG-RAN node and possibly neighbour NG-RAN nodes, as well as NR
E-CID measurements.</p>
<p>(2) The LMF provides the requested assistance in an LPP Provide
Assistance Data message, if available at the LMF. If any of the UE
requested assistance data in step (1) are not provided in step 2, the UE
shall assume that the requested assistance data are not supported, or
currently not available at the LMF. If none of the UE requested
assistance data in step (1) can be provided by the LMF, return any

<h2 id="ul-tdoa-positioning-1">8.13 UL-TDOA positioning</h2>
<h3 id="general-17">8.13.1 General</h3>
<p>In the UL-TDOA positioning method, the UE position is estimated based
on UL-RTOA (and optionally UL-SRS-RSRP and/or UL-SRS-RSRPP) measurements
taken at different TRPs of uplink radio signals from UE, along with
other configuration information.</p>
<p>The specifics of any UL-TDOA positioning methods or techniques used
to estimate the UE's location from these measurements are beyond the
scope of this specification.</p>
<p>In order to obtain uplink measurements, the TRPs need to know the
characteristics of the SRS signal transmitted by the UE for the time
period required to perform uplink measurement. These characteristics
should be static over the periodic transmission of SRS during the uplink
measurements. Hence, the LMF will indicate to the serving gNB the need
to direct the UE to transmit SRS signals for uplink positioning. It is
up to the serving gNB to make the final decision on resources to be
assigned and to communicate this SRS configuration information back to
the LMF so that LMF can forward the SRS configuration to the TRPs. The

<h5 id="assistance-data-delivery-between-lmf-and-gnb-1">8.13.3.2.1
Assistance Data Delivery between LMF and gNB</h5>
<p>The purpose of these procedures is to enable the gNB to provide
assistance data described in Table 8.13.2.0-1 to the LMF, for subsequent
delivery to the gNB using the procedures of clause 8.13.3.3 or for use
in the calculation of positioning estimates at the LMF or enable the LMF
to request UL-SRS configuration information from the serving gNB of a
target UE.</p>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.2.1-1 shows the UL information Delivery operation from
the serving gNB to the LMF.</p>
<p><img src="media/image48.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.2.1-1: LMF-initiated UL Information Request
Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST to
the serving gNB of the target UE to request UE SRS configuration
information. If the message includes the Requested UL-SRS Transmission
Characteristics as listed in Table 8.13.2.3-1, the gNB should take this
information into account when configuring UL-SRS transmissions for the
UE.</p>
<p>(2) The serving gNB determines the UE SRS configuration to be
allocated for the UE and sends NRPPa message POSITIONING INFORMATION
RESPONSE to the LMF that includes the UE SRS configuration defined in
Table 8.13.2.1-1. If the serving gNB is not able to provide the
requested information, it returns a failure message indicating the cause
of the failure.</p>
<p>(3) If a change has occurred in the UE SRS configuration during the
UE SRS time duration requested at step 1, the gNB sends a POSITIONING
INFORMATION UPDATE message to the LMF. This message contains, in the
case of a change in UE SRS configuration parameters, the UE SRS
configuration information for all cells with UE SRS configured, or an
update in SRS transmission status.</p>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.2.1-2 shows the TRP Information Exchange operation from

<p>Figure 8.13.3.2.1-2: LMF-initiated TRP Information Exchange
Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF determines that certain TRP configuration information is
desired (e.g., as part of a periodic update or as triggered by OAM) and
sends an NRPPa TRP INFORMATION REQUEST message to the gNB. This request
includes an indication of which specific TRP configuration information
is requested.</p>
<p>(2) The gNB provides the requested TRP information in an NRPPa TRP
INFORMATION RESPONSE message, if available at the gNB. If the gNB is not
able to provide any information, it returns an TRP INFORMATION FAILURE
message indicating the cause of the failure.</p>
<h4
id="location-information-transferassistance-data-transfer-procedure-1">8.13.3.3
Location Information Transfer/Assistance Data Transfer Procedure</h4>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request
position measurements from a gNB for position calculation of the UE and
also provide necessary assistance data to the gNB.</p>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.3-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to
perform this procedure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image49.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.3-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer
Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message to the selected gNB to request
UL-TDOA measurement information. The message includes any information
required for the gNB to perform the measurements as defined in Table
8.13.2.3-2.</p>
<p>(2) If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to "on demand",
the gNB obtains the requested UL-TDOA measurements and returns them in a
Measurement Response message to the LMF. The Measurement Response
message includes the obtained UL-TDOA measurements as defined in Table
8.13.2.2-1.</p>
<p>If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to "periodic", the gNB
replies with a Measurement Response message without including any
measurements in the message. The gNB then periodically initiates the
Measurement Report procedure in step 3 for the UL-TDOA measurements,
with the requested reporting periodicity.<br />
<br />
If the gNB is not able to accept the Measurement Request message in step
1, the gNB returns a failure message indicating the cause of the
failure.</p>
<p>(3) The gNB periodically provides the UL-TDOA measurements as defined
in Table 8.13.2.2-1 to the LMF if that was requested at step 1.</p>
<p>(4) At any time after step 2, the LMF may send a Measurement Update
message to the gNB providing updated information required for the gNB to
perform the UL-TDOA measurements as defined in Table 8.13.2.3-2. Upon
receiving the message, the gNB overwrites the previously received
measurement configuration information.</p>
<p>(5) If the previously requested UL-TDOA measurements can no longer be
reported, the gNB notifies the LMF by sending a Measurement Failure
Indication message.</p>
<p>(6) When the LMF wants to abort an ongoing UL-TDOA measurement it
sends a Measurement Abort message to the gNB.</p>
<h4 id="a-positioning-activationdeactivation-procedure">8.13.3.3a
Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure</h4>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request
activation and deactivation of UL-SRS transmission of the target UE.</p>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.3a-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to
perform this procedure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image50.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.3a-1: Positioning Activation/Deactivation
Procedure.</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Request message to
the serving gNB of the target UE to request UL-SRS activation for the
target UE. For a semi-persistent UL-SRS, the message includes an
indication of an UL-SRS resource set to be activated and may include
information that indicates the spatial relation for the semi-persistent
UL-SRS resource to be activated, as listed in Table 8.13.2.3-3. For an
aperiodic UL-SRS, the message may include aperiodic SRS Resource trigger
list to indicate the UL-SRS resource to be activated.</p>
<p>(2) For semi-persistent UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the
configured semi-persistent UL-SRS resource sets by sending the SP
Positioning SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE command as specified in
TS 38.321 [39]. For aperiodic UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate
the configured aperiodic UL-SRS resource sets by sending the DCI as
specified in TS 38.212 [40].<br />
If the UL-SRS has been successfully activated as requested in step 1,
the gNB sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to the
LMF. If the serving gNB is not able to fulfil the request from step 1,
it returns the Positioning Activation Failure message indicating the
cause of the failure. The serving gNB may include a system frame number
and a slot number in the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message
to the LMF.</p>
<p>(3) If a previously activated UL-SRS should be deactivated, or the
UL-SRS transmission should be released, the LMF sends the NRPPa
Positioning Deactivation message to the serving gNB of the target device
to request deactivation of UL-SRS resource sets, or release all the
UL-SRS resources. This message includes an indication of the UL-SRS
resource set to be deactivated, or an indication of releasing all UL-SRS
resources.</p>
<h4 id="sequence-of-procedure-for-ul-tdoa-positioning">8.13.3.4 Sequence
of Procedure for UL-TDOA positioning</h4>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.4-1 shows the messaging between the LMF, the gNBs and
the UE to perform UL-TDOA procedure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image60.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.13.3.4-1: UL-TDOA positioning procedure</p>
<p>0. The LMF may use the procedure in Figure 8.13.3.2.1-2 to obtain the
TRP information required for UL-TDOA positioning.</p>
<p>1. The LMF may request the positioning capabilities of the target
device using the LPP Capability Transfer procedure as described in
clause 8.13.3.1.</p>
<p>2. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST message to
the serving gNB to request UL-SRS configuration information for the
target device as described in Figure 8.13.3.2.1-1.</p>
<p>3. The serving gNB determines the resources available for UL-SRS and
configures the target device with the UL-SRS resource sets at step
3a.</p>
<p>4. The serving gNB provides the UL information to the LMF in a NRPPa
POSITIONING INFORMATION RESPONSE message.</p>
<p>5. In the case of semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS, the LMF may
request activation of UE SRS transmission by sending the NRPPa
Positioning Activation Request message to the serving gNB of the target
device as described in clause 8.13.3.3a. The gNB then activates the
UL-SRS transmission and sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response
message. The target device begins the UL-SRS transmission according to
the time domain behavior of UL-SRS resource configuration.</p>
<p>6. The LMF provides the UL-SRS configuration to the selected gNBs in
a NRPPa MEASUREMENT REQUEST message as described in clause 8.13.3.3. The
message includes all information required to enable the gNBs/TRPs to
perform the UL measurements.</p>
<p>7. Each gNB configured at step 6 measures the UL-SRS transmissions
from the target device.</p>
<p>8. Each gNB reports the UL-SRS measurements to the LMF in a NRPPa
Measurement Response message as described in clause 8.13.3.3.</p>
<p>9. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING DEACTIVATION message to the
serving gNB as described in clause 8.13.3.3a.</p>
<h2 id="ul-aoa-positioning">8.14 UL-AoA positioning</h2>
<h3 id="general-18">8.14.1 General</h3>
<p>In the UL-AoA positioning method, the UE position is estimated based
on UL-AoA (and optionally UL-SRS-RSRP and/or UL-SRS-RSRPP) of uplink
radio signals taken at different TRPs, along with other configuration
information.</p>
<p>The specific of any UL-AoA positioning methods or techniques used to
estimate the UE's location from these measurements are beyond the scope
of this specification.</p>
<p>In order to obtain uplink measurements, the TRPs need to know the
characteristics of the SRS signal transmitted by the UE for the time
period required to calculate uplink measurement. These characteristics
should be static over the periodic transmission of SRS during the uplink
measurements. Hence, the LMF will indicate to the serving gNB the need
to direct the UE to transmit SRS signals for uplink positioning. It is
up to the gNB to make the final decision on resources to be assigned and
to communicate this configuration information back to the LMF so that
LMF can configure the TRPs. The gNB may decide (e.g., in case no
resources are available) to configure no resources for the UE and fail
the corresponding NRPPa procedure.</p>

requested information, it returns a failure message indicating the cause
of the failure.</p>
<p>(3) If a change has occurred in the UE SRS configuration during the
UE SRS time duration requested at step 1, the gNB sends a POSITIONING
INFORMATION UPDATE message to the LMF. This message contains, in the
case of a change in UE SRS configuration parameters, the UE SRS
configuration information for all cells with UE SRS configured, or an
update in SRS transmission status.</p>
<p>Figure 8.14.3.2.1-2 shows the TRP Information Exchange operation from
the gNB to the LMF for the UL-AoA positioning method.</p>

Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF determines that certain TRP configuration information is
desired (e.g., as part of a periodic update or as triggered by OAM) and
sends an NRPPa TRP INFORMATION REQUEST message to the gNB. This request
includes an indication of which specific TRP configuration information
is requested.</p>
<p>(2) The gNB provides the requested TRP information in an NRPPa TRP
INFORMATION RESPONSE message, if available at the gNB. If the gNB is not
able to provide any information, it returns an TRP INFORMATION FAILURE
message indicating the cause of the failure.</p>

Location Information Transfer/Assistance Data Transfer Procedure</h4>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request
position measurements from a gNB for position calculation of the UE and
also provide necessary assistance data to the gNB.</p>
<p>Figure 8.14.3.3-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to
perform this procedure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image49.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.14.3.3-1: LMF-initiated Location Information Transfer
Procedure</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends a NRPPa message to the selected gNB to request
UL-AoA measurement information. The message includes any information
required for the gNB to perform the measurements as defined in Table
8.14.2.3-2.</p>
<p>(2) If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to "on demand",
the gNB obtains the requested UL-AoA measurements and returns them in a
Measurement Response message to the LMF. The Measurement Response
message includes the obtained UL-AoA measurements as defined in Table
8.14.2.2-1.</p>
<p>If the report characteristics in step 1 is set to "periodic", the gNB
replies with a Measurement Response message without including any
measurements in the message. The gNB then periodically initiates the
Measurement Report procedure in step 3 for the UL-AoA measurements, with
the requested reporting periodicity.<br />
<br />
If the gNB is not able to accept the Measurement Request message in step
1, the gNB returns a failure message indicating the cause of the
failure.</p>
<p>(3) The gNB periodically provides the UL-AoA measurements as defined
in Table 8.14.2.2-1 to the LMF if that was requested at step 1.</p>
<p>(4) At any time after step 2, the LMF may send a Measurement Update
message to the gNB providing updated information required for the gNB to
perform the UL-AoA measurements as defined in Table 8.14.2.3-2. Upon
receiving the message, the gNB overwrites the previously received
measurement configuration information.</p>
<p>(5) If the previously requested UL-AoA measurements can no longer be
reported, the gNB notifies the LMF by sending a Measurement Failure
Indication message.</p>
<p>(6) When the LMF wants to abort an ongoing UL-AoA measurement it
sends a Measurement Abort message to the gNB.</p>
<h4 id="a-positioning-activationdeactivation-procedure-1">8.14.3.3a
Positioning Activation/Deactivation Procedure</h4>
<p>The purpose of this procedure is to enable the LMF to request
activation and deactivation of UL-SRS transmission of the target UE.</p>
<p>Figure 8.14.3.3a-1 shows the messaging between the LMF and the gNB to
perform this procedure.</p>
<p><img src="media/image50.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 8.14.3.3a-1: Positioning Activation/Deactivation
Procedure.</p>
<p>(1) The LMF sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Request message to
the serving gNB of the target UE to request UL-SRS activation for the
target UE. For a semi-persistent UL-SRS, the message includes an
indication of an UL-SRS resource set to be activated and may include
information that indicates the spatial relation for the semi-persistent
UL-SRS resource to be activated, as listed in Table 8.14.2.3-3. For an
aperiodic UL-SRS, the message may include aperiodic SRS Resource trigger
list to indicate the UL-SRS resource to be activated.</p>
<p>(2) For semi-persistent UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate the
configured semi-persistent UL-SRS resource sets by sending the SP
Positioning SRS Activation/Deactivation MAC CE command as specified in
TS 38.321 [39]. For aperiodic UL-SRS, the serving gNB may then activate
the configured aperiodic UL-SRS resource sets by sending the DCI as
specified in TS 38.212 [40].<br />
If the UL-SRS has been successfully activated as requested in step 1,
the gNB sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to the
LMF. If the serving gNB is not able to fulfil the request from step 1,
it returns the Positioning Activation Failure message indicating the
cause of the failure. The serving gNB includes a system frame number and
a slot number in the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response message to
the LMF.</p>
<p>(3) If a previously activated UL-SRS should be deactivated, or the
UL-SRS transmission should be released, the LMF sends the NRPPa
Positioning Deactivation message to the serving gNB of the target device
to request deactivation of UL-SRS resource sets, or release all the
UL-SRS resources. This message includes an indication of the UL-SRS
resource set to be deactivated, or an indication of releasing all UL-SRS
resources.</p>
<h4 id="sequence-of-procedure-for-ul-aoa-positioning">8.14.3.4 Sequence

<p>0. The LMF may use the procedure in Figure 8.14.3.2.1-2 to obtain the
TRP information required for UL-AoA positioning.</p>
<p>1. The LMF may request the positioning capabilities of the target
device using the LPP Capability Transfer procedure as described in
clause 8.14.3.1.</p>
<p>2. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING INFORMATION REQUEST message to
the serving gNB to request UL-SRS configuration information for the
target device as described in Figure 8.14.3.2.1-1.</p>
<p>3. The serving gNB determines the resources available for UL-SRS and
configures the target device with the UL-SRS resource sets at step
3a.</p>
<p>4. The serving gNB provides the UL-SRS configuration information to
the LMF in a NRPPa POSITIONING INFORMATION RESPONSE message.</p>
<p>5. In the case of semi-persistent or aperiodic SRS, the LMF may
request activation of UE SRS transmission by sending the NRPPa
Positioning Activation Request message to the serving gNB of the target
device as described in clause 8.14.3.3a. The gNB then activates the
UL-SRS transmission and sends the NRPPa Positioning Activation Response
message. The target device begins the UL-SRS transmission according to
the time domain behavior of UL-SRS resource configuration.</p>
<p>6. The LMF provides the UL-SRS configuration to the selected gNBs in
a NRPPa MEASUREMENT REQUEST message as described in clause 8.14.3.3. The
message includes all information required to enable the gNBs/TRPs to
perform the UL measurements.</p>
<p>7. Each gNB configured at step 6 measures the UL-SRS transmissions
from the target device.</p>
<p>8. Each gNB reports the UL-SRS measurements to the LMF in a NRPPa
Measurement Response message as described in clause 8.14.3.3.</p>
<p>9. The LMF sends a NRPPa POSITIONING DEACTIVATION message to the
serving gNB as described in clause 8.14.3.3a.</p>

<p>It should be noted that in addition to the container provided by SUPL
itself, E-CID/NR E-CID positioning methods defined within LPP proper can
be supported in SUPL, via tunnelling LPP as shown in this annex (in the
same manner that A-GNSS, OTDOA, Barometric Pressure Sensors, WLAN,
Bluetooth and TBS are supported).</p>
<h1 id="a.2-supl-2.0-and-nr-architecture">A.2 SUPL 2.0 and NR
Architecture</h1>
<p>This clause describes interworking between the control-plane LCS
architecture, as defined in the main body of this specification, and
SUPL 2.0. Similarly, to the E-SMLC in the LTE architecture (TS 36.305
[25]), the LMF either includes or has an interface to an SPC function,
as defined in OMA SUPL V2.0 ([15], [16]). It can thus provide a
consistent set of positioning methods for deployments utilizing both
control-plane and user-plane.</p>
<p>The interworking does not enable use of user-plane signalling for
part of a control-plane positioning session. The user plane in the
interworking here is not intended as an alternative path for
control-plane signalling that would be needed between UE and NG-RAN for
mechanisms such as A-GPS in a standalone control-plane solution.</p>
<p>This interworking does enable the SPC to retrieve measurements (e.g.,
GNSS-to-RAN time relations) from the NG-RAN.</p>
<p>The underlying architecture is shown in Figure A.2-1 (TS 23.501 [2]).
Note that, for interworking between user-plane and control-plane
positioning, no new interfaces need to be defined as compared to those
in the figure, assuming the SPC is either integrated in the LMF or
attached to it with a proprietary interface.</p>
<p><img src="media/image62.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure A.2-1: System reference architecture reference for Location
Services in reference point representation</p>
<p>The Lup and Llp interfaces shown in this architecture are part of the
user-plane solution only and are not required for control-plane
positioning.</p>
<h1 id="a.3-lpp-session-procedures-using-supl">A.3 LPP session
procedures using SUPL</h1>
<p>This clause indicates how an LPP session relates to the SUPL message
set. Figure A.3-1 shows how SUPL and LPP can be combined within a SUPL
positioning session. Step 4 here is repeated to exchange multiple LPP
messages between the SLP and SET.</p>
<p><img src="media/image63.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure A.3-1: LPP session over SUPL</p>
<p>For positioning operations which take place entirely within an LPP
session (step 4 in Figure A.3-1), the flow of LPP messages can be the
same as in the control-plane version of LPP; the role of the (LPP)
target is taken by the target SET, and that of the (LPP) server by the
SLP. An example LPP flow, including exchange of capabilities, request
and delivery of assistance data, and request and delivery of positioning
information, is shown in Figure A.3-2.</p>
<p><img src="media/image64.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure A.3-2: LPP session over SUPL</p>
<h1 id="a.4-procedures-combining-c-plane-and-u-plane-operations">A.4
Procedures combining C-plane and U-plane operations</h1>
<p>Since SUPL by definition is carried over the user plane, it is not
applicable to operations terminating at the NG-RAN. SUPL operations must
take place in combination with control-plane procedures over NRPPa.</p>
<p>This situation could arise in the case of UE-assisted OTDOA, for
example, in which the SLP needs to provide the UE (in a SUPL session)
with assistance data supplied by the NG-RAN. This clause uses a
UE-assisted OTDOA positioning operation as an example.</p>
<p>Although the positioning server in this operation is the SLP, the
existence of an interface to the LMF means that the SLP can communicate
with the LMF via the SPC. In particular, this means that assistance data
that was delivered to the LMF via NRPPa can be transferred over to the
SLP for delivery to the UE via LPP over SUPL.</p>
<p>There are several ways to realise this general behaviour. In the
simplest case, the LMF could be supplied with the necessary assistance
data in advance, so that it can be supplied to the SLP without any
actual NRPPa procedures taking place in real time (and possibly even
before the positioning transaction begins).</p>
<p><img src="media/image65.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure A.4-1: Transfer of OTDOA assistance data to UE via SUPL</p>
<p>In the event that the LMF does not have the required assistance data
available, it would need to retrieve them from the NG-RAN once it was
made aware that they were needed.</p>
<p><img src="media/image66.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure A.4-2: Transfer to the UE via SUPL of OTDOA assistance data
not already available at the LMF</p>
<p>In both cases, it should be noted that the retrieval of the
assistance data is transparent to the UE and to the actual SUPL session.
This model is parallel to the approach used with A-GNSS, in which
assistance data such as satellite ephemerides are retrieved from sources
entirely external to the cellular network. For purposes of LPP over
SUPL, the delivery of assistance data to the SLP can be viewed as an
independent external process.</p>
<p>The delivery of assistance data to the UE, however, takes place
through the same mechanisms as control-plane LPP, transported through
SUPL.</p>
