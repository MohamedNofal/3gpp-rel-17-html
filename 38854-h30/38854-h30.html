<h1 id="introduction">4 Introduction</h1>
<p>5G NR operating in millimeter wave bands (i.e., Frequency Range 2) is
recognized as the technology capable of providing ultra-high data-rate
transmission, thanks to the availability of enormous amount of bandwidth
in FR2 and the advanced 5G NR design for FR2 beamforming-based
operation. Inspired by the successful commercial FR2 deployment
globally, more potential 5G NR deployment scenarios in FR2 draw
attentions from the industry. Among those scenarios identified, high
speed train (HST) scenario has the special importance, because of the
fast expanding HST systems worldwide deployed and the great demands of
high-speed connections from passengers and HST special services. This
triggers the new and challenging demand for 5G NR FR2 HST scenario.</p>
<p>In existing study and work items led by 3GPP RAN4 (for either LTE or
NR), high speed train scenarios under consideration has the operating
bands up to 3.5GHz, however no existing works studied the more
challenging millimeter wave frequency range 2, in which Doppler shift
and Doppler spread will be further severe (e.g., for 240km/h with 28GHz,
the Doppler shift is about 6.22kHz) and more challenging to radio
resource management. Specifically, the existing FR2 RRM and demodulation
requirements has not yet taken into account the impact of high speed in
the above-mentioned scenario, where the channel model and mobility
scenario need further study and the demodulation, measurement, mobility
and beam management related requirements require to be further
specified.</p>
<p>It should be noted that user equipment considered in 5G NR FR2 HST
scenario is vehicle-roof mounted customer-premises equipment (CPE),
which are expected to communicate with track-side deployed gNBs for the
backhaul link and to further provide on-board broadband connections to
user terminals and/or for other train-specific demands as access
link.</p>
<p>This work will specify NR UE RF requirements, UE RRM requirements and
BS/UE performance requirements for high speed train scenario with up to
350km/h in Rel-17.</p>

<p>Tunnel Deployment Scenario (study tunnel scenario after the
prioritized scenarios):</p>
<p>The detailed deployment scenario for tunnel deployment for FR2 HST is
still open in RAN4</p>
<p>- RAN4 will further study tunnel deployment scenario for FR2 HST.</p>
<p>Sub-Carrier Spacing (SCS):</p>
<p>It is still open which SCS options to consider. The options are:</p>
<p>- Option-1: SCS = 120kHz; and</p>
<p>- Option-2: Consider both SCS = 120kHz and 60kHz.</p>
<p>Concerning the transmissions schemes following schemes were discussed
in distinguished:</p>
<p>- JT: Joint Transmission scheme applied for all channel (SSB, TRS,
PDCCH, PDSCH) – Full SFN; and</p>
<p>- DPS: Dynamic Point Selection based on the Rel-15 beam management
(BM) principles; and</p>
<p>- Multi-DCI based Multi-TRP transmission based on the Rel-15 eMIMO
principles.</p>
<p>Among these the following down selection has been agreed:</p>
<p>- For this WI discussion, FR2 HST transmission schemes which are not
compatible with Rel-15/16 NR are precluded; and</p>
<p>- For this WI discussion, Joint transmission (JT) used for FR2 HST,
only full SFN is considered; and</p>
<p>- For this WI discussion, Multi-DCI based multi-TRP transmission is
precluded.</p>
<p>RAN4 primarily consider HST FR2 deployment with</p>
<p>- One train moving over one railway track in one direction. RAN4
focuses on 1 direction 1 train. If this opposite direction is completely
symmetric, the 1 direction study can apply directly; and</p>
<p>- RRHs are located on one side of the track.</p>
<p>Dedicated network for roof-mounted CPE:</p>
<p>- RAN4 to assume that in HST FR2 Scenario A, only high-speed CPEs
installed on the roof of the train can be present in the network.</p>
<p>RAN4 did comparison between unidirectional and bi-directional RRH
deployments for Scenario-A and concluded that from signal strength and
beam coverage perspective the bi-directional deployment will not provide
significant throughput improvement compared to unidirectional
deployment. This conclusion is based on the deployment scenario
analysis. RAN4 will only consider unidirectional deployments for
Scenario-A. Bi-directional deployment can be considered if the
feasibility issue of unidirectional deployment is identified.</p>
<p>RAN4 assume that FR2 HST with CPEs is operated as dedicated network.
Hence, assumption in RAN4 is that in HST FR2 Scenario A and B, only
high-speed CPEs installed on the roof of the train can be present in the
network. There is no need to differentiate roof-mounted CPE from other
FR2 UEs in HST FR2 scenario.</p>
<p>RAN4 will not consider curvature when defining the requirements.</p>
<h2 id="hst-scenario-and-rrh-parameters">5.2 HST scenario and RRH
parameters</h2>
<p>RAN4 will investigate both unidirectional and bidirectional
deployment scenarios for FR2 HST.</p>
<p>The exact understanding and definition of HST still needs further
discussion based on the following interpretations:</p>
<p>- HST Interpretation-1: All RRHs under one BBU transmit the same
signal (SFN).</p>
<p>- Selected RRH(s) for TX, depending on DPS Tx mode is used or
not.</p>
<p>- HST Interpretation-2: All RRHs under one BBU in the same cell ID,
but for different TCI.</p>
<p>- Other interpretation is not precluded.</p>
<p>For full SFN JT and unidirectional RRH deployment, only consider
following scenario:</p>
<p>- The setting with only one TCI state transmission.</p>
<p>The value of Ds_offset implicitly limit the RRH beam direction, so
there is no need to introduce additional restriction on RRH beam’s
possible range of angle on azimuthal plane.</p>
<h3 id="unidirectional-deployments">5.2.1 Unidirectional
deployments</h3>
<p>For the unidirectional scenario RAN4 will consider a scenario, where,
one panel per RRH pointed to the same direction for all RRHs (figure

<h3 id="rrh-parameters">5.2.3 RRH Parameters</h3>
<p>The detailed RRH parameters are still under discussion in RAN4 and
following options have been agreed for potential down selection:</p>
<p>Number of RRH sites per BBU:</p>
<p>- [1 to 4] RRHs sites per BBU; and</p>
<p>- Other values are not precluded.</p>
<p>Number of Analog Beams per panel in RRH:</p>
<p>- [1,2,4] analogue beam(s) per panel in RRH; and</p>
<p>- Other values are not precluded.</p>
<p>SSB index to Beam Mapping. The impact of following options for SSB
index to Beam mapping is FFS:</p>
<p>1) Option 1:</p>
<p>a) All RRHs (connected to one BBU with fiber) share the same cell ID;
and</p>
<p>b) All RRHs under the same cell use the same set of SSB indexes,
e.g., all RRHs use SSB-0 to SSB-3.</p>
<p>2) Option 2:</p>
<p>a) All RRHs (connected to one BBU with fiber) share the same cell ID;
and</p>
<p>b) RRHs under the same cell use the different sets of SSB indexes,
e.g., RRH-1 uses SSB-0 to SSB-3, RRH-2 uses SSB-4 to SSB-7.</p>
<p>When DPS is used as transmission scheme, SSB index to Beam Mapping
used in the discussion for this WI is as follows:</p>
<p>RRHs under the same cell use different sets of SSB indexes, e.g.,
RRH-1 uses SSB-0 to SSB-3, RRH-2 uses SSB-4 to SSB-7, etc.</p>
<p>RAN4 discussed the aspect of potential handover problem due to sudden
RX signal increase of the target cell. RAN4 thinks that this can be
alleviated by DPS transmission scheme with carefully allocated SSB-index
among neighboring cells to avoid inter-cell interference.</p>
<p>Concerning RRH antenna array orientation the impact of following
options for RRH antenna array orientation is FFS:</p>
<p>- Option 1: RRH panel boresight pointed to the railway in the middle

or</p>
<p>- Other option is not precluded.</p>
<p>Related to RRH/UE boresight direction of Antenna Panel and beam
direction, RAN4 may not need to specify RRH/UE boresight direction of
antenna panel and beam direction for deployment scenario study, but left

model used for link budget evaluation</h3>
<p>To have the link budget analysis for the proposed FR2 HST deployment
scenarios, the accurate large-scale pathloss model is one of the
prerequisites. The following large scale pathloss models are proposed to
be considered as candidate options:</p>
<p>- Option-1: TR38.901 RMa LoS (baseline option); or</p>
<p>- Option-2: free space model; or</p>
<p>- Option-3: TR38.901 UMa LoS.</p>

<p>RAN4 to choose TS38.901 RMa LoS pathloss model also for the
evaluation of Scenario 4 in table 5.1-1.</p>
<p>For the purpose of demonstrating and validating which large scale
channel modeling is suitable for FR2 HST, the analysis has been provided
based on the practical field measurement. Specifically, based upon the
conditions provided in the Table 6.2.1-1, the practical field testing on

<p>By having the analysis based on the measurement data obtained from
the measurement campaign as above described, the comparison among
measurement results and pathloss models (i.e., the three options of RMa
LOS, UMa LOS and free space model) is demonstrated in Figure 6.2.1-2 and

<p>By leveraging the numerical results in terms of the root mean square
error (RMSE), mean error and standard deviation (Std), it has been
demonstrated that for the evaluated range there is no significant
difference from three different pathloss LoS models, and the field
measurement also validate that LoS model can reflect the practical FR2
HST channel condition compared with NLoS models. By further
investigating three LoS models’ similarity from measurement data, it has
been demonstrated that RMa LoS model can achieve the lowest value of
RMSE and best mean error with reasonable standard deviation.</p>

<p>Based upon the above analysis on the measurement data from the

<h3 id="channel-modelling-for-performance-requirements">6.2.2 Channel
modelling for performance requirements</h3>
<p>Based on WID as follows, RAN4 is tasked to further study the channel
model for FR2 HST, where the key question needs to be answer:</p>
<p>- Whether or not single-tap per RRH channel model is assumed in UL
direction; and</p>
<p>- Whether single- or multi-tap model is assumed in DL direction.</p>
<p>Compared with the FR1 counterpart, the major difference of having
analog beamforming in FR2 should be considered in determining channel
model for performance requirement. Depending on whether or not joint
transmission is allowed for FR2 HST, it could be possible to have
multiple taps from neighboring RRHs, while if only DPS is allowed single
tap model should be employed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, whether or not the single tap is accurate enough for a
single TX-RX link in FR2 HST scenario has been studied. Specifically, a
measurement-data-calibrated FR2 HST ray-tracing model is used to
simulate various paths of LoS and reflected path for a practical railway
scenario. As required by WID, the UE is mounted on top of the driver’s
cabin of the train in the simulation. And the traveling length is 2000
m, with a sampling distance of 20 m, thus making 200 snapshots (UE
locations) be simulated.</p>

<p>For each given UE location, the received signals from 4 RRHs are
simulated by using the ray-tracing model. Numerically, it has been
demonstrated that all simulated snap shots have the ratio of received
non-first-tap power over total received power smaller than 0.01, or in
other words, in all snap shots, the first tap can contain more than 99%
of the energy, which validate the single-tap assumption from a single
TX-RX link in FR2 HST.</p>

style="width:5.82847in;height:4.36597in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.2.2-2 CDF of the ratio of non-first-tap power over total
power</p>
<p>Based on measurement-data-calibrated ray-tracing modeling at 28GHz
for typical railway environment, it has been validated that the
single-tap is accurate enough to represent a single TX-RX link for FR2
HST. Therefore, it is agreed that for channel modelling for performance
requirement, the single-tap can be assumed for a single TX-RX link at
least for Scenario-A.</p>
<p>Editor Note: FFS multi-tap models are needed for SFN and other
scenarios and FFS channel model for Scenario-B.</p>
<p>For channel modelling for performance requirement evaluation:</p>
<p>- Single-tap can be assumed for a single TX-RX link at least for
scenario 2 in table 5.1-1.</p>
<p>RAN4 agreed that for both uplink and downlink the cosine of angle
θ(t) used in Doppler shift in channel model is applied. This applies
for:</p>
<p>- A particular uni-directional deployment scenario; and</p>
<p>- A particular bi-directional deployment scenario.</p>
<p>The single tap propagation model can be assumed for each single Tx-Rx
link for both scenario 2 and scenario 4 in table 5.1-1</p>
<p>RAN4 agreed that the uplink and downlink channel model in
uni-directional deployments one channel model (either toward to serving
beam or away from serving beam) is applied for demodulation requirement
even if UE can travel in two directions in practice.</p>
<p>RAN4 will use the following HST-DPS channel model as a starting point
for FR2 HST uni-directional RRH deployment:</p>
<p>- UE is moving towards the serving beam</p>
<p>- The cosine of angle θ(t) used in Doppler shift <span
class="math inline">\({f_{s}(t) = f_{d}\ \cos}{\theta(t)}\)</span> is
provided as</p>
<p>- <span class="math inline">\(\cos{\theta(t)} = \frac{D_{s\_ offset}\
\mathbf{+}\mathbf{D}_{\mathbf{s}} - vt}{\sqrt{D_{\min}^{2} + \left(

<p>- <span class="math inline">\(0\  \leq D_{s\_ offset} &lt;

<p>The Ds_offset value for introducing performance requirements is 10m
and 100m for Scenarios A and B, respectively. The Ds_offset value has no
restriction concerning deployments and the value is only used for
developing the demodulation requirements. The Ds_offset is derived from
the worst case based on analysis of deployment scenarios. Note,
demodulation simulation assumptions should cover at least one Doppler
shift jump region.</p>
<p>RAN4 decided regarding the HST FR2 channel model in bi-directional
deployment to use option 2 with DPS based channel model as starting
point and based on this RAN4 agreed to use the following cosine values
for the different schemes 2a – 2c below. Of the options RAN4 agreed to
apply channel modelling as option 2a for FR2 HST Bi-directional RRH

<p>RAN4 agrees to use DPS channel model for both uni-directional and
bi-directional for performance requirements.</p>
<p>It was agreed that TCI switching belongs RRM scope, and there is no
need to model and consider this in demodulation requirements.
Demodulation requirements will not verify the PDSCH performance during
TCI switching period. No propagation delay and delay jump modelling in
channel model for DL PDSCH demodulation.</p>
<h2 id="fr2-feasibility-evaluation">6.3 FR2 Feasibility Evaluation</h2>
<p>RAN4 perform feasibility study on FR2 HST scenario, by at least
considering following aspects:</p>
<p>1) The feasibility of a deployment based the beam dwelling time and
measurement period framework:</p>
<p>a) How many beams/SSBs per RRH can be deployed (given other
deployment parameters such as D<sub>min</sub>, D<sub>s</sub>, speed etc)
while maintain mobility performance with FR2 BM mechanism?; and</p>
<p>b) How much beam refinement is needed to achieve coverage and
mobility?</p>
<p>- How much beam overlapping area is needed (given other deployment
parameters such as Dmin, Ds, speed etc.) to ensure beam refinement
procedure can be executed successfully?</p>
<p>2) Study throughput performance and mobility performance:</p>
<p>a) More number of analogue beams and sharper beam may provide better
link budget performance but more challenging on mobility
performance.</p>
<p>3) Receive timing difference.</p>
<p>4) Maximum supported Doppler shift for both UL and DL and maximum
supported UE speed.</p>
<p>Other feasibility study is not precluded.</p>
<p>For evaluating the maximum supported speed following numerology will
be considered:</p>
<p>- For FR2 HST evaluations and possible performance requirements
definition, RAN4 only consider 120kHz SCS as baseline assumption.</p>

<h3 id="connected-mode">6.3.2 Connected mode</h3>
<h4 id="number-of-rx-beams">6.3.2.1 Number of Rx beams</h4>
<p>RAN4 discussed the Rx beam number for RRM requirements definition and
agreed to define two sets of enhanced RRM requirements in terms of the
number of Rx beams (i.e., Rx beam sweeping scaling factor) per UE:</p>
<p>- Set 1: 2 Rx beams</p>
<p>- Set 2: 6 Rx beams</p>
<p>Set 1 is more relevant to the deployments where the RRHs are located
next to the railway track, e.g., like in Scenario-A with Dmin = 10m.
Whereases, Set 2 can be used in the scenarios where RRHs are further
away from the track, e.g., like Scenario-B with Dmin=150m.</p>
<p>The analysis below is based on the system-level simulations carried
out following the assumptions and parameters from Table 6.3.8.1-1.</p>
<p>It was found out that in priority scenarios additional beams oriented
upwards (i.e., up from the horizontal plane parallel to the railways
track) do not provide meaningful pefromance gains. Therefore, the
analysis below is focusing only on the beams with different orientations
in the horizontal plane.</p>
<p>Following the antenna panel parameters from the Section 6.1, the
half-power width for the RRH boresight beam is around 12.6 degrees (8x8
panel). Whereas the half-power width of the UE boresight beam is around
26 degrees (4x4 panel).</p>
<h5 id="scenario-a">6.3.2.1.1 Scenario-A</h5>
<p>The considered deployment is uni-directional Scenario-A where the
train is traveling in the direction opposite to the serving beam as
presented in Figure 6.3.2.1.1-1. It is assumed that the RRH panel is
oriented towards the projection of the following RRH on the railway
track, and only one beam is used per RRH panel. The UE panel boresight
is parallel to the railway track.</p>
<p><img src="media/image22.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.2.1.1-1: HST FR2 Uni-directional deployment, the train is
moving towards the serving beam.</p>
<p>In Figure 6.3.2.1.1-2, simulation results (cumulative distribution
function of SINR) are shown when only one Rx beam with fixed orientation
is configured at the UE. It can be seen that the beam co-oriented with
the UE panel’s boresight (RxBeams1-90) provides the highest SINR.</p>

alt="Chart, histogram Description automatically generated" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.2.1.1-2: CDF of SINR for different orientations of a
single Rx beam.</p>
<p>Next, a scenario where multiple Rx beams can be used at the UE side
is considered. In Figure 6.3.2.1.1-3, it is demonstrated that no gain
from using more than one boresight beam (i.e., the beam 90) is observed
even if all of the additional beams are oriented towards the RRH.</p>

<h4 id="scenario-b">6.3.2.1.2 Scenario-B</h4>
<p>A scheme of uni-directional deployments in HST FR2 Scenario-B is
shown in Figure 6.3.2.1.2-1. We also indicate the orientation of Tx
beams at RRH and Rx beams at CPE used in the simulations.</p>
<p><img src="media/image25.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.2.1.2-1: The schemes of uni- and bi-directional
deployments in HST FR2 Scenario-B with the orientation of Tx and Rx
beams.</p>
<p>From Figure 6.3.2.1.2-2 it can be noticed that increasing the number
of Tx beams on RRH side provides very minor gain in HST FR2
uni-directional Scenario-B if only one Rx beam is used. Indeed, in this
case, the CPE stays mostly in the coverage area of the boresight Tx
beam, and additional beams are not used much.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.2.1.2-2: SINR CDF in uni-directional Scenario-B for
different number of Tx beams when only one Rx beam parallel to the track
is used.</p>
<p>Firstly, the scenario where one boresight Tx beam is used at the RRH
and one Rx beam is used at the UE is considered. Different UE Rx beams
directions are compared in Figure 6.3.2.1.2-3. The results demonstrate
that Rx beam orientation has a significant impact on performance. For
example, wrong orientation of Rx beam (e.g., to the other side from the
RRH) results in the significant loss of performance. It was also found
that Rx beam oriented 10-15 degrees from the UE panel boresight towards
the RRH (i.e., RxBeams1-80, RxBeams1-75) provide best performance in
Scenario-B.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.2.1.2-3: L1-RSRP traces of serving RRH (top) and SINR CDFs
(bottom) in uni-directional Scenario-B for different orientations of Rx
beams.</p>
<p>Next, it is studied how the performance depends on the orientation of
one Rx beam when multiple Tx beams are used. These results are shown in
Figure 6.3.2.1.2-4. Like in Figure 6.3.2.1.2-2, one can observe that
adding more Tx beams when only one Rx beam parallel to the track is used
does not provide significant gain. However, if we orient the Rx beam
more towards the RRH, then in the areas next to the RRH the received
signal power can be significantly increased.</p>

(bottom) in uni-directional Scenario-B with multiple Tx beams and for
different orientations of Rx beam.</p>
<p>Finally, the scenario where multiple (four) Tx and multiple (up to
four) Rx beams are configured together is analyzed (Figure 6.3.2.1.2-5).
It is shown that the correct choice of Rx beams improves the received
signal strength in the areas where the coverage of additional Tx beams
is present. The median value of the SINR can be increased for around 4
dB. One can also notice that the use of 2 and 3 Rx beams provide
significant gains, whereases the gain from more additional beams (e.g.,
4 in total) is not significant.</p>

<h5 id="scenario-a-uni-directional-rrh-deployment">6.3.3.1.1 Scenario-A,
Uni-directional RRH Deployment</h5>
<p>As provided in clause 6.2 for the detailed simulation assumption and
the detailed beam configuration in Table 6.3.3.1.1-1, it has been shown
that with 1 beam per RRH panel and 1 beam per UE panel, the link budget
performance is satisfactory, in terms of at least ~30dB margin over FR2
PC4 REFSENS requirement and at least ~21dB margin over FR2 PC4 spherical
coverage requirement, as illustrated in following figure. Even
considering 31dBm for TX power is a bit optimistic assumption for 8x8
panel configuration (e.g., with per element P_out = 12dBm and 3dB
polarization gain, 8x8 panel can achieve 12 + 10log(64) + 3 = 34dBm
without considering any implementation margin), the cellular coverage
should still be satisfactory with implementation margin considered.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.3.1.1-1 RX power without UE RX beamforming, Scenario-A,
Uni-directional</p>
<p>Next, we take UE RX beamforming gain into account, and assume 1 beam
per panel (which is existing agreement in R4-2106100). For simplicity,
it is assumed that UE boresight direction is opposite to RRH boresight
direction (i.e., the largest UE beamforming gain is achieved when UE is
located at the projection point of the neighboring RRH on the railway).
It is shown in the following figure, with UE RX beamforming gain into
account, the received signal power after RX beamforming is no less than
-50dBm even for the nearest coverage point (which is corresponding to
least RX beamforming gain around 15dB), which also should be regarded as
satisfactory link performance.</p>

<h6 id="scenario-a-bi-directional">6.3.3.2.1.1 Scenario A,

<p>There are two schemes for Bi-directional deployment. Considering very
small Dmin, the angle between RRH-UE line and the railway can be
negligible, so only Scheme-1 is for further analysis.</p>

to the railway at the distance of Ds, the beam is pointed to the railway

<p>Figure 6.3.3.2.1.1-2 Link budget for Scheme-1</p>
<p>For Scheme-1, the power of side-lobes for different beams change
rapidly when UE is near to the RRH and the minimum time duration for the
best beam with same beam index can be far less than 160 ms that is the
L1-RSRP measurement period for HST FR2 scenario. It is a great challenge
for the UE to ensure the performance not to degrade in such location. UE
can use different strategy by implementation, such as select the best
beam as per RSRP measurement result or directly switch the UE beam point
to the main-lobe beam transmission from the next RRH. For the former
one, the best beam may be unavailable with high probability once UE beam
switching has been performed.</p>

<h4 id="link-level-performance-from-ericsson">6.3.3.3 Link level
performance from Ericsson</h4>
<p>For scenario A and B, uni- and bi-directional scenarios, Ericsson
provided evaluation in contributions R4-2104679 and R4-2104680. The
analysis has been performed using the antenna array configurations in
sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.3.</p>
<h5 id="scenario-a-uni-directional-rrh-deployment-1">6.3.3.3.1
Scenario-A, Uni-directional RRH Deployment</h5>
<p>For this scenario, it was assumed that the RRHis positioned such that
the antenna(s) face directly along the track; i.e. a zero degree steered
beam is parallel to the track (in both azimuth and elevation). The UE on
the train is positioned such that it’s antenna(s) point directly along
the track.</p>
<p>Zero beam steering was assumed, and so the RRHbeam points along the
track (but is 10m away from the track) and the UE beam points along the
track.</p>
<p>These assumptions are not fully optimal, but they are sufficient to
demonstrate that a single TX and a single RX beam is sufficient.</p>
<p>The antenna radiation patterns in azimuth for the UE and RRHare
depicted in figure 6.3.3.3.1-1. The array is symmetrical in both axes,
so the elevation patterns are the same as the azimuth patterns.</p>
<p><img src="media/image45.png"
style="width:2.89583in;height:1.74071in" /><img src="media/image46.png"
style="width:2.95172in;height:1.77431in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.1-1: RRH and UE antenna radiation patterns in azimuth
(Elevation patterns are the same)</p>
<p>The most critical link for coverage is the uplink. Thus, the uplink
was modelled considering 23dBm transmitter power for the UE. For a train
mounted UE, this may be an underestimate for the power.</p>
<p>The coverage pattern for the single TX / RX beam is depicted in
figure 6.3.3.3.1-3. A uni-directional deployment is considered in which
the RRHantenna is pointing in the direction of movement of the train and
the UE antenna away from the direction of movement of the train. The x
axis represents the distance along the track from the point on the track
that is closest to the RRH. (That implies, at zero on the x axis the UE
on the side is parallel to the RRH which is 10m away from the side of
the track). The y axis represents UL SNR assuming 10dB noise figure at
the RRH</p>
<p><img src="media/image47.png"
style="width:7.1875in;height:2.50694in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.1-2: Unidirectional deployment scenario</p>
<p>As can be seen in the figure, good coverage is obtained when the
train is further than 60-70m along the track from the RRH. Furthermore,
the SNR remains good from 700-800m; i.e. the SNR from the RRHat position
zero on the track is still good as the UE passes the next RRH (located
at 700m along the track)</p>
<p><img src="media/image48.png"
style="width:5.01389in;height:3.01389in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.1-3: UL SNR for single TX and single RX beam</p>
<p>Using DPS, the UE can switch RRH after travelling around 60-70m along
the track from RRH2 in the figure. Assuming that this is the case, then
the SNR observed when travelling along the track is as depicted in
figure 4. For downlink, the SNR will be greater.</p>
<p><img src="media/image49.png"
style="width:6.12083in;height:3in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.1-4: UL SNR assuming single TX/RX beam and DPS
switching between RRH</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, we observe that in scenario 1, in a
uni-directional deployment it is sufficient to operate with a single TX
beam and a single RX beam.</p>
<h5 id="scenario-a-bi-directional-rrh-deployment-1">6.3.3.3.2
Scenario-A, Bi-directional RRH Deployment</h5>
<p>Uni-directional deployment in Scenario A provides very good coverage.
Bi-directional deployment would require connection to the second nearest
basestation when the UE would be within around 50m from a basestation
due to the large azimuth angle to the nearest RRH at that point. Thus,
bi-directional deployment would require double the antenna
infrastructure at basestations with no coverage or capacity gain.</p>
<p>If RRH are equipped with two antenna, improved throughput can be
obtained by operating each direction as an independent uni-directional
UE. In a future release, multi-antenna single UE operation may also be
introduced.</p>
<h5 id="scenario-b-uni-directional-rrh-deployment-1">6.3.3.3.3
Scenario-B, Uni-directional RRH Deployment</h5>
<p>To consider the number of beams and coverage, a deployment has been
analyzed considering scenario B. The RRH antennas are rotated by 13
degrees towards the track, whilst the UE antenna points parallel to the
track. Up to 3 RRH beams and up to 2 UE beams are considered. Uplink SNR
is considered for depicting the coverage of the beams, since UL SNR is
the most critical scenario. DL SNR will be larger than UL SNR.</p>
<p>The x axis represents the distance along the track from the point on
the track that is closest to the RRH. (That implies, at zero on the x
axis the UE on the side is parallel to the RRH, which is 150m away from
the side of the track). The y axis represents UL SNR assuming 10dB noise
figure at the RRH and 23dBm UE TRP.</p>

<p><img src="media/image52.png"
style="width:5.01389in;height:3.01389in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.3-3: Coverage of RRH beam 3 + UE beam 2</p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.3-1 indicates that the first RRH beam can provide
coverage from around 300-400m along the track to around 1km along the
track. This means that the RRH can provide coverage to a point well
beyond the following RRH. Figures 6.3.3.3.3-2 and 6.3.3.3.3-3 indicate
that the remaining beams can provide coverage closer to the RRH.</p>
<p>There is little point in providing more beams. Beam 3 provides
coverage from around 100-150m from the RRH. Closer to the RRH, beam 1
from the previous RRH is able to provide coverage. Further beams closer
to the RRH would be narrow in coverage and do not improve SNR.</p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.3-4 indicates the SNR if a single TX/RX beam (beam 1)
is used and coverage close to the RRH is provided from the previous/next
RRH. The figure indicates that good UL SNR of above 15dB (DL SNR will be
larger than this) can be provided along the length of the track with one
TX and one RX beam.</p>
<p><img src="media/image53.png"
style="width:5.01389in;height:3.01389in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.3-4: Coverage provided from next and previous RRH with
1 beam per RRH and UE antenna.</p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.3-5 depicts the coverage obtained with 3 beams per RRH
antenna and 2 beams per UE antenna, considering both the current and
previous RRH. The figure shows that the lowest SNR level can be improved
a few dB compared to the single beam case.</p>
<p><img src="media/image54.png"
style="width:5.01389in;height:3.01389in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.3-5: Coverage provided from next and previous RRH with
3 beams per RRH antenna and 2 beams per UE antenna.</p>
<p>Thus, we observe that it is perfectly feasible to assume just on beam
per antenna also for scenario B as long as the RRH antenna is oriented
slightly towards the track. There is some scope for further optimization
if 3 RRH / 2 UE beams are considered. Also, allowing for more beams
offers more robustness for covering track curves.</p>
<h5 id="scenario-b-bi-directional-rrh-deployment-1">6.3.3.3.4
Scenario-B, Bi-directional RRH Deployment</h5>
<p>For bi-directional deployment, half of the distance along the track
would be covered by one RRH and the other half by the following RRH</p>
<p><img src="media/image55.png"
style="width:7.22083in;height:2.50694in" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.3.3.3.4-1: Bi-directional deployment scenario</p>
<p>The figure below depicts the achievable coverage using 3 beams at the
RRH and 3 beams at the UE, with the RRH and UE antennas pointed parallel
to the track. After 350m along the track, coverage would be provided by
the next RRH. To avoid a break in coverage close to the RRH, the next
nearest RRH should be used to serve the UE when it is close in to a
RRH.</p>

direction with DPS switching between beams and RRH</p>
<h4 id="throughput-performance-from-nokia">6.3.3.4 Throughput
Performance from Nokia</h4>
<p>The throughput CDFs are obtained from fully dynamic system-level
simulations, which were carried out to evaluate RRM requirements and
mobility performance under high-speed train scenarios in FR2.
Simulations were performed with train speed 350 km/h in both
uni-directional Scenario-A and -B. In bi-directional case only
throughput results for Scenario-B are covered. 50MHz channel bandwidth
is assumed.</p>
<p>The results include “non-SFN and non-DPS” (i.e., without DPS)
transmission scheme analysis corresponding to L3-mobility based on the
traditional HO procedure. In these simulations, it is assumed that each
BBU has only one RRH corresponding to a more challenging mobility
scenario due to longer delays. Alternatively, simulation results for
Dynamic Point Selection (DPS) deployments assume that all RRHs are
connected to the same BBU, i.e., the mobility is based on L1
measurements and is provided by beam management procedures instead of
HO.</p>
<p>On the RRH side, the number of Tx beams is chosen according to the
deployment, i.e., only 1 Tx beam in Scenario-A, and 1 or 2 Tx beams in
Scenario-B.</p>
<p>The simulation assumptions and parameters for the evaluation of
mobility performance are shown in Table 6.3.8.1-1 6.3.4.1.1-1 and
6.3.4.1.2-1 without DRX.</p>
<p>Throughput statistics are shown in figures 6.3.3.4-1, 6.3.3.4-2,
6.3.3.4-3, 6.3.3.4-4, 6.3.3.4-5, 6.3.3.4-6, 6.3.3.4-7 and 6.3.3.4-8. The
used metric is windowed user (CPE) throughput where each sample
represents average throughput over 100 ms window of the CPE. The maximum
achievable CPE throughput in this scenario setting with 50 MHz and
maximum modulation 64QAM is about 300 Mbps when there is only one CPE
served by a cell at a time. Both the performance with enhanced RRM
requirements (Req: Enhanced) and legacy RRM requirements (Req: Legacy)
are shown in the figures.</p>
<p>The results demostrate that in the investigated uni-directional
scenarios maximum throughput is achieved over 90% of the time. The
reason for such a high performance is that there is only one CPE in the
simulated area at a time creating very favorable interference
conditions. Propagation condition is fully LOS, which causes the
coverage area of a RRH to be long along the track. Also, mobility
performance (see 6.3.4.1) in non-DRX case is sufficient to keep CPE most
of the time in the cell and beam with good signal conditions. In the
uni-directional scenario where train is traveling to opposite direction
than RRH beams are pointing to the throughput performance tends to be
lower than in the cases where train is traveling to the same direction
as RRH beams are pointing to. The reason for this is in the mobility
performance that is clearly better in the same direction case. However,
enhanced requirements clearly also improve the throughput performance of
the opposite direction case. The throughputs in DPS deployment are
higher than without DPS in all uni-directional cases.</p>
<p>In the bi-directional scenarios maximum throughputs are achieved more
seldom i.e., 40-60% of the window samples. One reason, why throughput in
bi-directional Scenario-B is not optimal might be because UE is not
connected to the closest RRH but to the next closest one, e.g., like it
is shown in Figure 5.2.2-3. Bi-directional scenarios are also affected
by more frequent handovers and beam switches compared to uni-directional
scenarios, which can cause small breaks in data transmission affecting
throughput for some of the sampled windows. However, also bi-directional
scenario throughput performance gets better when enhanced RRM
requirements are applied, despite the lower number of Rx beam options in
use compared to legacy RRM requirements. The delay in switching to a
better cell or beam gets lower with enhanced requirements. The
throughputs in DPS deployment are higher than without DPS in all
bi-directional cases.</p>

Simulations were performed with train speed 350 km/h in both uni- and

<p>The results include “non-SFN and non-DPS” (i.e., without DPS)

<p>Additionally, different settings are considered for DRX

Uni-directional Scenario-A without DPS</h6>
<p>This section shows system level simulation mobility performance
results for uni-directional Scenario-A without DPS for both the case
when train is traveling into same direction (Dir:Same in legends) as RRH
beam are pointing to and into opposite direction (Dir:Opposite in
legends). Figure 6.3.4.1.1.1-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE
per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per
all handovers. Ping-pong handover is observed when two handovers happen
back and forth between two same cells in one second. It is observed that
handover and ping-pong rates are the highest without DRX and gradually
decrease when DRX cycle is increased. Significant drop in successful
handovers is observed when train travels to opposite direction than RRH
beams are pointed to and DRX is used. Ping-pongs are not observed in the
cases with DRX configured.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.1.1-2 shows average time-of-stay in cell (RRH). It is
observed that without DRX the time-of-stay in RRH is slightly lower than
the time train with 350 km/h speed takes to travel the distance of one
Ds of 700 meters (about 7.2 seconds). This result is due to ping-pongs
observed in Figure 6.3.4.1.1.1-1. With DRX cycles 80-160 ms the
time-of-stay increases to over 7 seconds.</p>

handover execution time, the time it takes to perform radio link failure
related procedures from observing radio link problem until
re-establishment of connection and the time below -8 dB SINR conditions
are observed in the simulation even prior to radio link problem can be
detected based on filtering. It is observed from the results that
significant outage is detected only in case train travels to opposite
direction than RRHs are pointing to and DRX is used.</p>

that failure rate is very high in case train is traveling to opposite

legacy RRM requirements. DRX 40 ms causes about 70% failure rate and DRX
80-160 ms causes even higher number of problems with over 80% failure
rate in this scenario. No failures are observed when train is traveling
into same direct as RRH beams are pointing to.</p>

Scenario-A with DPS</h6>
<p>This section shows system level simulation mobility performance
results for uni-directional Scenario-A with DPS. Some of the observed
statistics are of different type than in the section without DPS. Figure
6.3.4.1.1.2-1 shows successful beam switch rate per CPE per second and
ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong beam switches per all beam
switches. Beam ping-pong is observed when two beam switches happen back
and forth between two same beams in one second. Practically in
Scenario-A with just one Tx beam per RRH this means ping-pongs between
RRHs. In DPS case the same trend is observed in beam switches as with
handovers in non-DPS case, without DRX the rates are the highest and
gradually rates decrease when longer DRX cycles are used. The
differences between the rates in train travel direction are rather low
except in the case with DRX cycle 160 ms where beam switch rate drops
significantly when train in traveling to opposite direction.</p>

as without DPS that the time-of-outage rates are very low when train is
traveling to the same direction as RRH beams are pointing to and none of
the outages are caused by low SINR. In the opposite direction
time-of-outage starts to increase significantly when DRX cycles are 40
ms or longer. However, time-of-outage is significantly lower than
without DPS due to lower delay when switching to different RRH location.
Regardless of this the case of DRX cycle 160 ms has very significant
time-of-outage in the opposite direction.</p>

Uni-directional Scenario-B without DPS</h6>
<p>This section shows system level simulation mobility performance
results for uni-directional Scenario-B without DPS. Also, comparison
between 1 and 2 beams per RRH is included in this section. Figure
6.3.4.1.1.3-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and
ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers.
It is observed that without DRX the handover rate is the highest and it
drops when DRX cycle 40 ms is used but remains at approximately same
level with all simulated DRX cycles. This indicates that there is more
time to perform handover in Scenario-B than in Scenario-A particularly
when comparing the cases when train is traveling to opposite direction
than the RRH beams are pointing to. It is also observed that without DRX
there are higher handover and ping-pong rates with 1 beam per RRH than 2
beams per RRH.</p>

than the time train with 350 km/h speed takes to travel the distance of
one Ds of 700 meters (about 7.2 seconds) particularly with 1 Tx beam per
RRH. This result is due to ping-pongs observed in Figure 6.3.4.1.1.3-1
in similar way as in Scenario A. Time-of-stay is relatively close among
all studied DRX cycles in this scenario and close to the expected
time-of-stay based on Ds.</p>

also observed than without DRX and DRX 40 ms there is clear gain in SINR
from having 2 beams per RRH compared to 1 beam per RRH, but when longer

general levels of handover and ping-pong rates are clearly higher in
bi-directional scenario than in uni-directional scenario.
Uni-directional Scenario-B has maximum of about 0.2 HO/CPE/s and
bi-directional has over 0.8 HO/CPE/s. Ping-pongs are much more common

ms there is clear gain in SINR from having 2 beams per RRH compared to 1
beam per RRH, but when longer DRX is applied the gain is no longer
observed. This is caused by the delays in selecting optimal beams with
longer DRX. It is noted that SINR level in low SINR percentiles is lower
in bi-directional scenario than uni-directional Scenario-B. Possible
reasons for this include using multi-panel UE assumption 1 in
bi-directional scenario where two panels per CPE are used. With this
assumption only one panel can be activated at the time and used for
measurements causing some additional delays in mobility and beam
management.</p>

Bi-directional Scenario-A without DPS</h6>
<p>This section shows system-level mobility performance simulation
results for bi-directional Scenario-A without DPS with legacy RRM
requirements. In addition to other parameters varied in the rest of the
scenarios, the results with both multi-panel assumption 1
(MPUEAssumption:as1) and 3 (MPUEAssumption:as3) are shown here. With
assumption 1, only one panel at a time can perform measurements and with
assumption 3 both panels can measure at the same time.</p>
<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.1.7-1 shows handover rate per CPE per second and
ping-pong handover rate relative to all handovers. It is observed that
assumption 3 increases the number of handovers, but not always the
number of ping-pongs in this scenario. When measuring with both panels
at the same time the measurements are more up to date, which may reduce
back-and-forth ping-pong handovers. As seen in other scenarios, longer
DRX cycles significantly reduce the number of handovers.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.1.7-2 shows average time-of-stay in a cell. In
bi-directional scenario, time-of-stay is very short without DRX due to
frequent handovers. The time-of-stay is generally longer with assumption
1 due to more delays in following the best radio conditions, causing
less handover to occur. Also, longer DRX cycles increase the average
time-of-stay in a cell.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.1.7-3 shows time-of-outage statistics for both the
total percentage of outage conditions relative to call length and
average durations of outage due to low SINR level. With legacy
requirements, the time-of-outage is very significant even without DRX
and when multi-panel UE assumption 1 is configured. This is caused by
the long delays due to legacy scaling factor 8 particularly when train
is traveling towards the serving beam and quickly passing through the
RRH location.</p>

cycles and multi-panel assumptions. It is observed that with legacy
requirements only cases without DRX can provide fast enough mobility
procedures to maintain good SINR level. However, with assumption 1, also
the case without DRX has significantly degraded SINR for over 5% of the
samples.</p>

<p>This section shows system-level mobility performance simulation
results for bi-directional Scenario-A with DPS with legacy
requirements.</p>
<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.1.8-1 shows beam switch and beam ping-pong rates. The
results show that the beam switch rate is significantly higher with
multi-panel assumption 3, which is inline with the results seen in
6.3.4.1.1.7 for handovers in non-DPS case. Also, longer DRX cycles
decrease the number of beam switches. Ping-pong rates are much more
variant depending on DRX cycle where multi-panel assumptions are rather
equal except in DRX 80 ms case, where there is higher ping-pong rate
with assumption 3.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.1.8-2 shows time-of-outage statistics with DPS. The
results show that the rates generally increase with longer DRX but are
lower than in non-DPS case in 6.3.4.1.1.7. Non-DRX case does not cause
significant outages with either assumption 1 or 3. Due to high delays
caused by legacy requirements and DRX, the time-of-outage can be high
with both multi-panel assumptions when the longest DRX cycle is
used.</p>

scenario. It is observed that beam failures are either not observed at
all or almost zero without DRX depending on the multi-panel assumption.
However, when DRX cycle increases the failure indication rates become
high with both assumptions.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.1.8-4 shows SINR distributions for all simulated DRX

significantly degrades when mobility delays are increased with DRX
cycles. The SINR difference between multi-panel assumptions is not so
clear as in non-DPS case in 6.3.4.1.1.7. Assumption 3 gives gain in
median and peak percentiles of the CDF particularly without DRX, but
assumption 1 can be better in low percentiles of the CDF.</p>

Uni-directional Scenario-A without DPS</h6>
<p>This section shows system level simulation mobility performance
results for uni-directional Scenario-A without DPS for both the case
when train is traveling into same direction (Dir:Same in legends) as RRH
beam are pointing to and into opposite direction (Dir:Opposite in
legends). Figure 6.3.4.1.2.1-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE
per second and ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per
all handovers. Ping-pong handover is observed when two handovers happen
back and forth between two same cells in one second. It is observed that
handover and ping-pong rates are the highest without DRX and gradually
decrease when DRX cycle is increased. Significant drop in successful
handovers is observed when train travels to opposite direction than RRH
beams are pointed to and DRX cycle is increased to 160 ms.</p>

<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.2.1-2 shows average time-of-stay in cell (RRH). It is
observed that without DRX the time-of-stay in RRH is significantly lower
than the time train with 350 km/h speed takes to travel the distance of
one Ds of 700 meters (about 7.2 seconds). This result is due to
ping-pongs observed in Figure 6.3.4.1.2.1-1. With DRX cycles 80-160 ms
the time-of-stay increases to about 7 seconds.</p>

call includes all the sources of outage combined. This consists of
handover execution time, the time it takes to perform radio link failure
related procedures from observing radio link problem until
re-establishment of connection and the time below -8 dB SINR conditions
are observed in the simulation even prior to radio link problem can be
detected based on filtering. It is observed from the results that
significant outage is detected only in case train travels to opposite
direction than RRHs are pointing to and DRX cycles are 80 ms or
longer.</p>

similarly as significant time-of-outage rates are observed only scenario
where train travels to opposite direction than RRHs are pointing to
causes mobility failures among the simulated DRX cycles. DRX 80 ms
causes about 7% failure rate and DRX 160 ms causes very significant
problems with over 60% failure rate in this scenario. No failures are
observed when train is traveling into same direct as RRH beams are
pointing to.</p>

results for uni-directional Scenario-A with DPS. Some of the observed
statistics are of different type than in the section without DPS. Figure
6.3.4.1.2.2-1 shows successful beam switch rate per CPE per second and
ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong beam switches per all beam
switches. Beam ping-pong is observed when two beam switches happen back
and forth between two same beams in one second. Practically in
Scenario-A with just one Tx beam per RRH this means ping-pongs between
RRHs. In DPS case the same trend is observed in beam switches as with
handovers in non-DPS case, without DRX the rates are the highest and
gradually rates decrease when longer DRX cycles are used. The
differences between the rates in train travel direction are rather
low.</p>

the outages are caused by low SINR. In the opposite direction
time-of-outage starts to increase significantly when DRX cycles are 80
ms or longer. However, time-of-outage is significantly lower than
without DPS due to lower delay when switching to different RRH

between 1 and 2 beams per RRH is included in this section. Figure
6.3.4.1.2.3-1 shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and
ping-pong rate as percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers.
It is observed that without DRX the handover rate is the highest and it
drops when DRX cycle 40 ms is used but remains at approximately same
level with all simulated DRX cycles. This indicates that there is more
time to perform handover in Scenario-B than in Scenario-A particularly
when comparing the cases when train is traveling to opposite direction
than the RRH beams are pointing to. It is also observed that without DRX
there are higher handover and ping-pong rates with 1 beam per RRH than 2

also observed than without DRX and DRX 40 ms there is clear gain in SINR
from having 2 beams per RRH compared to 1 beam per RRH, but when longer
DRX is applied the gain is no longer observed. This is caused by the
delays in selecting optimal beams for longer DRX.</p>

results for bi-directional Scenario-B without DPS. Figure 6.3.4.1.2.5-1
shows successful handover rate per CPE per second and ping-pong rate as
percentage of ping-pong handovers per all handovers. It is observed that
general levels of handover and ping-pong rates are clearly higher in
bi-directional scenario than in uni-directional scenario.
Uni-directional Scenario-B as maximum of about 0.2 HO/CPE/s and
bi-directional has almost 0.7 HO/CPE/s. Ping-pongs are much more common
even with DRX in bi-directional scenario.</p>

comparison to uni-directional scenario.</p>

ms there is clear gain in SINR from having 2 beams per RRH compared to 1
beam per RRH, but when longer DRX is applied the gain is no longer
observed. This is caused by the delays in selecting optimal beams with
longer DRX. It is noted that SINR level in low SINR percentiles is lower
in bi-directional scenario than uni-directional Scenario-B. Possible
reasons for this include using multi-panel UE assumption 1 in
bi-directional scenario where two panels per CPE are used. With this
assumption only one panel can be activated at the time and used for
measurements causing some additional delays in mobility and beam
management.</p>

Bi-directional Scenario-A without DPS</h6>
<p>This section shows system level mobility performance simulation
results for bi-directional Scenario-A without DPS with enhanced RRM
requirements. In addition to other parameters varied in the rest of the
scenario the results with both multi-panel assumption 1
(MPUEAssumption:as1) and 3 (MPUEAssumption:as3) are shown here. With
assumption 1, only one panel at a time can perform measurements and with
assumption 3 both panels can measurement at the same time.</p>
<p>Figure 6.3.4.1.2.7-1 shows handover rate per CPE per second and
ping-pong handover rate. It is observed that assumption 3 increases the
number of handovers, but not the number of ping-pongs in this scenario.
When measuring with both panels at the same time, the measurements are
more up to date, which may reduce back-and-forth ping-pong handovers. As
it can be seen in other scenarios, longer DRX cycles significantly
reduce the number of handovers. Enhanced requirements increase the
number of handovers compared to legacy requirements due to lower
mobility delays from measurements.</p>

bi-directional scenario, time-of-stay is very short without DRX due to
frequent handovers. The time-of-stay increases with longer DRX cycles.
The time-of-stay is generally shorter with enhanced requirements due to
lower mobility delays compared to legacy requirements.</p>

Also, multi-panel assumption 1 can provide good SINR without DRX in over
95% of the samples. Higher DRX cycles have significantly degraded SINRs
with assumption 1.</p>

in the scenario with legacy requirements. The SINR difference between
multi-panel assumptions is not so clear as in non-DPS case in
6.3.4.1.2.7. Assumption 3 gives gain in median and peak percentiles of

<h5 id="conclusions-on-mobility-performance">6.3.4.1.3 Conclusions on
mobility performance</h5>
<p>In the previous sections (6.3.4.1.1.1, 6.3.4.1.1.2, 6.3.4.1.2.1,
6.3.4.1.2.2), it was demonstrated that HST FR2 Scenario-A deployment
(Figure 6.3.4.1.3-1) where the train is travelling in the direction
opposite to serving beam orientation may experience mobility challenges
when DRX cycle of 40 ms is used with legacy requirements. This happens
due to the very fast degradation of serving RRH signal (Figure
6.3.4.1.3-2). However, there is a significant improvement in Scenario-A
from enhanced requirements compared to legacy requirements. With
enhanced requirements, mobility robustness is sufficient when DRX cycle
of 40 ms is used, but problems can be observed when DRX cycle is
increased to 80 ms when the train is travelling in the direction
opposite to serving beam orientation.</p>

<p>The RSRP traces of the serving (RRH1) and target (RRH2) RRHs are
shown in Figure 6.3.4.1.3-3 with at different zoom levels. One can
observe that the signal level from target RRH get high enough already
much earlier than handover happens. However, the source RRH signal drops
drastically near the RRH location. In this traced case, the handover
happens early enough to transmit control messages even with realistic
PDCCH model. It is also obvious that even slight delays in handover
initiation will cause source RRH to drop to unreachable levels (e.g.,
RSRP below -120 dBm).</p>

complete, and source RRH location.</p>
<p>Based on the simulation results and analysis presented above we can
conclude that DRX cycle of 80ms shall be used with precautions in
uni-directional Scenario-A.</p>
<p>In sections (6.3.4.1.1.3, 6.3.4.1.1.4, 6.3.4.1.1.5, 6.3.4.1.1.6,
6.3.4.1.2.3, 6.3.4.1.2.4, 6.3.4.1.2.5, 6.3.4.1.2.6) it was demonstrated
that Scenario-B mobility performance with enhanced RRM requirements in
both uni-directional and bi-directional scenarios is sufficient with DRX
cycles up to 80 ms. Compared to legacy RRM requirements the mobility
robustness measured by mobility failure and time-of-outage rates is
significantly improved with enhanced RRM requirements also in
Scenario-B.</p>
<p>In sections 6.3.4.1.1.7, 6.3.4.1.1.8, 6.3.4.1.2.7, 6.3.4.1.2.8, it
was shown that Scenario-A with bi-directional deployment needs similar
precautions for DRX cycle of 80 ms as uni-directional scenario. Also,
bi-directional scenario mobility robustness is significantly improved by
the enhanced RRM requirements compared to legacy RRM requirements.
Multi-panel UE measurement assumption was also shown to have significant
impact to mobility robustness particularly in non-DPS scenario. Having
UE capability to measure both directions at the same time can benefit
mobility robustness.</p>

<p>The simulation results of beam dwelling time are shown in figures
6.3.8.1-1-3 for unidirectional scenarios with a different number beams
transmitted by RRH. The simulation results of beam dwelling time are
shown in figures 6.3.8.1-4-6 for bidirectional scenarios with different
number of beams transmitted by RRH.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that the simulation results are the average beam
dwelling time. In the simulation, beam dwelling time is influenced by
beam coverage and beam switching rate (including hysteresis). Beam
coverage is discussed in detail in clause 6.3.8.2, where ideal beam
dwelling time is investigated.</p>
<p>In the case of multi-beam operation cases shown in figures 6.3.8.1-2,
6.3.8.1-3, 6.3.8.1-5 and 6.3.8.1-6, it can be observed that the dwelling
time of Beam 0 is the shortest because the coverage of Beam 0 is the
smallest.</p>

</table>
<p>As can be observed in table 6.3.8.2-1, the beam coverage length
shrinks as <span class="math inline">\(y_{k}\)</span> decreases,
resulting in non-uniform beam coverage. A beam with very short beam
segment length <span class="math inline">\(l_{k}\)</span> is not useful
for HST because the UE may not be able detect it before moving to the
adjacent beam. As such, the number of useful beams per RRH can be
limited, which depends on deployment scenarios. Referring to the
equation of the ellipse, the beam footprint size is a function of the
semimajor axis <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and semiminor axis
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. It can be observed from the
equation that one key parameter that influences the magnitude of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the elevation HPBW <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_{HPBW}\)</span> and azimuth HPBW <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_{HPBW}\)</span>. This means, those beams with
a short segment length can be increased by widening the HPBW. However,
it is important to note that antenna array directivity is inversely
proportional to the HPBW; that is, a wider HPBW leads to lower
antenna-array directivity. As the RRH typically employs uniform
rectangular antenna arrays, the directivity <span
class="math inline">\(D\)</span> can be expressed in terms of the
elevation and azimuth HPBW as [2]</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(D \approx
\frac{\pi^{2}}{\phi_{HPBW}\theta_{HPBW}}\)</span></p>
<p>For Beam <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, if <span
class="math inline">\(\theta_{HPBW}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi_{HPBW}\)</span> are widened by a factor of
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\theta,k}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\phi,k}\)</span>, respectively, the
resultant directivity <span class="math inline">\(D_{k}\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(D_{k} = \frac{\pi^{2}}{\left(
\sigma_{\theta,k}\ \theta_{HPBW} \right)\left( \sigma_{\phi,k}\
\phi_{HPBW} \right)}\)</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D_{0}\)</span> denote the original
directivity of Beam 0 (where the HPBW is not widened) and dividing it by
<span class="math inline">\(D_{k}\)</span> yields</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\frac{D_{0}}{D_{k}} = \sigma_{\phi,k}\
\sigma_{\theta,k}\)</span></p>
<p>As compared with <span class="math inline">\(D_{0}\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(D_{k}\)</span> is now dropped by the product of
<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\phi,k}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\theta,k}\)</span>, where both terms are
real numbers. In order to ensure the link budget (or performance) of
Beam <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is not worse than Beam <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> as a consequence of using lower
directivity, the product (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\phi,k}\
\sigma_{\theta,k}\)</span>) should be bounded by the condition</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(1 \leq \left( \sigma_{\phi,k}\
\sigma_{\theta,k} \right) \leq \left( \frac{r_{0}}{r_{k}}
\right)^{2}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(r_{k} &lt;
r_{0}\)</span></p>
<p>where the term <span class="math inline">\(\left( \frac{r_{0}}{r_{k}}
\right)^{2}\)</span> is the ratio of the free space path loss between
Beams <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, and for <span
class="math inline">\(r_{0} = \left| \overrightarrow{{GP}_{0}}
\right|\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(r_{k} = \left|
\overrightarrow{{GP}_{k}} \right|\)</span>. Beam <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> serves as a baseline beam whose
directivity equals the original unenlarged HPBW. When <span
class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\phi,k}{\ \sigma}_{\theta,k} = \left(
\frac{r_{0}}{r_{k}} \right)^{2}\)</span> the drop in directivity for
Beam <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is equalized by the decrease
in free space path loss with reference to Beam <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Widening the HPBW of beams with a short segment length in coverage
areas near to the RRH provides an alternative solution to mitigate the
problem identified in clause 6.3.4.1 for unidirectional deployment
scenarios, where the UE is moving in the opposite direction to the
pointing direction of RRH Tx beams. It can also be used to extend
coverage in areas near to RRH in bi-directional deployment scenarios,
and to reduce the large propagation delay jump, which causes uplink
timing issues.</p>

<p>RAN4 will further study and discuss the CPE core requirements.</p>
<p>Concerning the CPE RF requirements RAN will further discuss and
select among following options for the baseline power class:</p>
<p>- Baseline power class for FR2 HST:</p>
<p>1) Option-1: PC4 as baseline, and FFS PC4 requirement is applicable
to FR2 HST scenario; or</p>
<p>2) Option-2: To define new PC for FR2 HST; or</p>
<p>3) Option-2a: To define new PC for FR2 HST, with PC5 requirement as
baseline.</p>
<p>Additionally, RAN4 will further discuss how the specify the UE RF
requirements. Options listed are:</p>
<p>- Option-1: Provide an applicability rule of FR2 PC4 for the
train-roof-mounted UE for FR2 HST scenario, i.e., the applicable FR2 PC4
requirement set for FR2 HST scenario; or</p>
<p>- Option-2: Revisit the full set of UE RF requirements for FR2 PC4
UE; or</p>
<p>- Option-3: New RF requirement is defined for FR2 HST UE which is
different from PC4, specifically, the min peak EIRP for FR2 HST UE
follows the agreement for PC5(new FR2 FWA UE).</p>
<p>For power class, it is agreed to introduce a new power class for FR2
HST UE (UE power class 6), by numbering as UE power class 6 and
specifying UE type as ‘High Speed Train Roof-Mounted UE’:</p>

<p>The RF requirement applicability rule (based on NW flag signalling)
is not introduced. FR2 HST UE shall satisfy the relevant RF requirement,
regardless of this NW flag signalling. Additionally, RAN4 define unified
RF requirement for both uni- and bi-directional RRH deployment.</p>
<p>It was agreed that the UE TX minimum output power and transmit signal
quality for FR2 PC6 UE, RAN4 adopt the same requirement as FR2 PC5 UE
for are:</p>
<p>- Minimum output power, and</p>
<p>- Transmit signal quality</p>
<p>For UE TX requirement for UL-MIMO it was agreed that similar to other
power classes, RAN4 define UL-MIMO TX requirements for FR2 PC6 UE, by
following the same requirement as PC6 single TX port requirement
numerically.</p>
<p>It was agreed that unified RF requirements for FR2 HST UE are defined
except spherical coverage. RAN4 will further discuss the spherical
coverage requirements:</p>
<p>- Option 1: use the union of the largest spherical coverage of theta
and phi to define the unified requirements</p>
<p>- Option 2: The unified RF requirement for FR2 HST UE is defined
based on one particular scenario requiring the largest spherical
coverage</p>
<p>RAN4 agreed not to define core requirement for one-panel based
spherical coverage requirement.</p>
<p>For UE RF requirement framework, RAN4 agreed to use the assumption,
that UE has two panels, i.e., back-to-back panels, which will be used to
derive spherical coverage requirements.</p>
<p>RAN4 will further discuss whether one panel based spherical coverage
requirement will be specified and whether to mandate two panels for UE
RF requirement framework. Concerning spherical coverage and the
direction of the antenna panels RAN4 reached following agreements:</p>
<p>- Directions of antenna panels:</p>
<p>- Boresight directions for forward and backward panels shall be
declared by UE vendors. It is FFS whether the limitation on the
boresight directions is needed.</p>
<p>- Coordination system to be used for requirement definition:</p>
<p>- Option-1: absolute coordination system</p>
<p>- Option 2: relative coordination system (relative to the claimed
boresight direction)</p>
<p>- Spherical coverage x%-tile point per panel:</p>
<p>- Azimuth angle (i.e., phi) range to cover:</p>
<p>- Option-1: [-45, +45] degree relative to absolute coordination
system</p>
<p>- Option-2: [-25, +25] degree relative to UE declared boresight
direction</p>
<p>- Other options are not precluded</p>
<p>- Elevation angle (i.e., theta) range to cover:</p>

<h2 id="rrm-requirements">7.2 RRM requirements</h2>
<p>Concerning the maximum supported speed for FR2 HST RAN4 agreed to use
350kmph as a reference maximum train speed and define RRM requirements
to guarantee that.</p>
<p>It was agreed to add a flag to enable the UE to identify
different/enhanced RRM requirements in HST FR2 deployments. FR2 HST UE
has the capacity to support both unidirectional and bidirectional
deployment scenarios. RAN4 agreed to introduce network assistance to
inform UE on the FR2 HST deployment type (uni-directional or
bi-directional). No enhanced requirement should be applied to other than
PC6 UEs even when HST FR2 flags are configured.</p>
<p>PC6 shall be used to identify the feature support of HST FR2
operation.</p>
<p>RAN4 agreed to introduce dedicated new RRC based network signalling
flag will be specified to enable/disable one shot large UL timing
adjustment. Such RRC based network signalling is not limited to a
particular FR2 HST deployment and/or scenarios, i.e., bi-directional
scenario or uni-directional scenario.</p>
<p>In Scenario A, whether the RRH position on one side or both sides of
railway tracks have no impact on RRM requirements under the assumption
that FR2 HST UE boresight direction (or the beam direction if there is
only one beam) is parallel to the track.</p>
<p>Under FR2 HST scenarios, the PSS/SSS detection is robust to deal with
ISI and time differences.</p>
<p>Additional need for network signalling and CPE capabilities for HST
FR2 deployments continued based on the deployment options and presence
of non-CPE UEs. It was agreed that it is not necessary to introduce UE
capability to indicate the support of FR2 HST.</p>
<p>It was also concluded that there is no need for CPE capability to
change beam sweep number in uni-/bi-directional operation.</p>
<p>RAN4 agreed to introduce network signaling to configure UE to follow
either Set 1 or Set 2 RRM requirements.</p>
<p>Concerning the number of Rx Beams from RRM perspective RAN4 agreed
that related to the scope of the RRM requirements and the requirements
for Scenario A and scenario B to only define two sets of enhanced RRM
requirements in terms of number of RX beams (i.e. RX beam sweeping
scaling factor) per UE:</p>
<p>- Set 1: 2 RX beams</p>
<p>- Set 1: 6 RX beams</p>
<p>RAN4 will introduce network signalling to configure UE to follow
either Set 1 or Set 2 RRM requirements.</p>
<p>Set 1 requirements are developed based on the analysis with Dmin =
10m and Ds = 750m, and the recommended applicable range of Dmin for Set
1 requirement is Dmin &lt;= [30] m. For the deployment with a larger
Dmin, set 2 requirements are recommended to be configured by the
network.</p>
<p>Regarding RRM requirements for scenario A and scenario B, for
uni-directional and bi-directional deployments, it was agreed that there
separate requirements for uni-/bi-directional deployments will not be
developed.</p>
<p>For scenario B only, when considering requirements for RRH deployment
on both sides of the track, the RRH positions at one/both sides of rail
track doesn’t have impact on 6Rx beams agreement in Scenario B (set
2).</p>
<p>Concerning <u>Lightweight network assistance signaling it will be
discussed further</u> which NWA signaling is needed:</p>
<p>- Option 1: Enable network assisted signaling of SSB index and order
per RRH</p>
<p>- Option 2: The network assistance signaling of SSB configuration
shall not be introduced in Rel-17</p>
<p>- Option 3: Introduce inter-RRH indication</p>
<p>- Option 4: Other options are not precluded</p>
<p><u>For Inter-RRH indication RAN4 agreed not introduce explicit
inter-RRH indication signalling for NR FR2 HST in Rel-17.</u></p>
<p><u>UE capabilities:</u></p>
<p>FR2 HST UE (power class 6 UE) shall mandatorily support both Set 1
and Set 2 enhanced RRM requirements, in terms of different RX beams
(i.e., RX beam sweeping scaling factor) per UE.</p>
<p>It is agreed to introduce feature group x-2 “Support of one shot
large UL timing adjustment” with prerequisite feature group (x-1,
“Support of FR2 HST operation”).</p>
<h3 id="idleinactive-mode-1">7.2.1 Idle/inactive mode </h3>
<p>RAN agreed for idle/inactive mode that the cell reselection
requirements in IDLE/INACTIVE mode are enhanced.</p>
<p>Concerning requirements for when UE is applying long DRX RAN4 agreed
to apply the existing R16 requirements for when the long DRX cycles are
used, i.e. above the upper bound of DRX cycle.</p>
<p>HST FR2 enhanced requirement is applied to SMTC &lt;=40ms. SMTC
periodicity is not restricted.</p>
<p>RAN4 will only define enhanced requirements for DRX 320 ms and
requirements for longer DRX cycles are left without changes.</p>
<p>For the M2 scaling factor for short DRX the way forward is to use as
baseline: M2 = 1.5 if SMTC periodicity &gt; [40] ms, otherwise M2=1.
Discussion continues whether different scaling factor is needed for
scenario-B with two-side RRH.</p>

<p>RAN4 will introduce additional TCI switching delay for UE to perform

<p><u>Uplink Spatial Relation Switch Delay:</u></p>
<p>For the known conditions for spatial relation when associated with
DL-RS, the requirement defined in Rel-16 shall be reused, and no
standard impact is expected for Rel-17 FR2 HST</p>
<h4 id="ue-ul-transmit-timing">7.2.2.1 UE UL transmit timing</h4>
<p>RAN4 discussed the UE requirements related to UE transmit timing and
the UE gradual timing adjustment if the necessary adjustments to be made
to the UE uplink timing exceed the current adjustment rules.</p>
<p>RAN4 agreed that it is up to network configuration to enable one shot
large uplink timing adjustment mechanism. If one shot large uplink
timing adjustment is disabled, existing uplink timing adjustment, i.e.,
RA based mechanism, and related existing RAN4 requirements will be
applied when needed. Otherwise, RAN4 will introduce a mechanism for one
shot large uplink timing adjustment for FR2 HST scenarios with UE
allowed to adjust uplink timing beyond T<sub>q</sub>.</p>
<p>With network signalling to enable one shot large timing adjustment UE
shall apply one shot large timing adjustment on TCI switching occasion
if UE measurement on DL timing difference is larger than a timing
difference threshold:</p>
<p>- Option 1: 9*64*Tc = CP/2</p>
<p>- Option 2: Tq = 4.5*64*TC = CP/4</p>
<p>- Option 3: Select a threshold from above options or new options, and
the performance degradation due to timing error on both DL and UL to UE
and network after TCI state switch is expected if network assistant
signalling to inform UE on cross RRH TCI state switch is not
introduced.</p>
<p>- Other options are not precluded</p>
<p>RAN4 will further study RRM requirement, and acceptable value of
residual error in UE large one-shot UL timing adjustment. RAN4 will
further discuss the accuracy performance and testing issues based on
conclusion of related procedures.</p>
<p><u>Random Access Procedure:</u></p>
<p>No specification change shall be introduced for the current RA
procedure due to Rel-17 FR2 HST.</p>
<h5 id="random-access-based-timing-adjustment">7.2.2.1.1 Random Access
based timing adjustment</h5>
<p>When large one-shot UL timing adjustment procedure is disabled, i.e.,
when the <em>highSpeedLargeOneStepUL-TimingFR2-r17</em> flag defined in
TS 38.331 is false, there is still a need to adjust UL timing of the UE
to address a large difference in radio propagation delays in between the
source and the target beams.</p>
<p>A large jump in propagation delays is typical for inter-RRH TCI state
switch in uni-directional scenarios, e.g., shown in Figure 5.2.1-2.
However, RAN4 has also agreed that
<em>highSpeedLargeOneStepUL-TimingFR2-r17</em> signaling is not limited
to a particular FR2 HST deployment and/or scenarios, i.e.,
bi-directional scenario or uni-directional scenario. Therefore,
network-based solution shall also be applicable for the bi-directional
scenarios (e.g., shown in Figures 5.2.2-5,6,7) where the jump in
propagation delays cannot be avoided either.</p>
<p>Since beam management procedures were originally designed in NR
Rel-15, it is generally assumed that the Tx beams are collocated, i.e.,
a large propagation delay difference in between the source and the
target beams is not expected. Hence, TCI state change does not imply any
explicit UL synchronization procedure, such as RA as a part of HO.</p>
<p>The straightforward approach in the term of HST FR2 Rel-17 WI is to
use already existing and standardized procedures for UL timing
adjustment. Random Access (RA) towards the target TCI state provides a
possibility for the network to measure the propagation delay from the RA
preamble and to signal the accurate UL timing advance value with random
access reply (RAR). Transmission of RA preamble itself can be triggered
with the PDCCH order.</p>
<p>An example of sequence diagram of the procedure is shown in Figure
7.2.2.1-1. The upper box includes the beam management related operations
that are repeated periodically, such as transmission of reference
signals in the UL, network-initiated and small-scale autonomous UL
timing adjustments, beam/SSB measurements, detection, and reporting,
etc. The core of the network-controlled UL timing adjustment mechanism
is contained in the lower box that is executed when the NW triggers TCI
state switch.</p>

<p>UE demodulation test:</p>
<p>For Test cases definition and test applicability rule RAN4 will
define UE demodulation requirements with transmission schemes with test
applicable rule as:</p>
<p>1) Case 1: Uni-directional scenario A with DPS scheme 1b.</p>
<p>2) Case 2: Bi-directional scenario B with DPS scheme 1a.</p>
<p>3) Test applicable rule</p>
<p>a) If UE is capable of more than 1 activated TCI state, UE should
pass test both case 1 and case 2, otherwise, UE should only pass test of
case 2</p>
<p>4) It is RAN4 common understanding that if UE passes case 1
(Uni-directional scenario A with DPS scheme 1b), the performance of
Uni-directional scenario B with DPS scheme 1b are also guaranteed.</p>

<p>Test Setup for UL timing adjustment requirement:</p>
<p>It was agreed to introduce UL timing adjustment requirements for FR2
HST. <u>For test applicability it was agreed to</u> share the same
applicability rule with PUSCH. Additionally, it was agreed the
<u>manufacturer declaration on HST FR2 DM-RS support – UL TA – to</u>
share the same manufacturer declaration with PUSCH.</p>
<p>1) Waveform:</p>
<p>a) Only CP-OFDM.</p>
<p>2) CBW: align CBW for UL timing adjustment and PUCH requirements.
50MHz and 200MHz CBWs are defined with the test applicability rule that
only one of them is tested based on BS manufacturer. The existing PUSCH
applicability rule for different channel bandwidth for UL timing
adjustment requirements are:</p>
<p>a) For each subcarrier spacing declared to be supported, the test
requirements for a specific channel bandwidth shall apply only if the BS
supports it.</p>
<p>b) Unless otherwise stated, for each subcarrier spacing declared to
be supported, the tests shall be done only for the widest supported
channel bandwidth. If performance requirement is not specified for this
widest supported channel bandwidth, the tests shall be done by using
performance requirement for the closest channel bandwidth lower than
this widest supported bandwidth; the tested PRBs shall then be centered
in this widest supported channel bandwidth.</p>
<p>3) PUSCH resource allocation:</p>
<p>a) 50MHz CBW: 16RBs for each UE, Moving UE RBs: 0~15; Stationary UE
RBs: 16~31</p>

configuration</p>
<p>- Define FRC for 1 DMRS + PT_RS (L=1, K=2)</p>
<p>b) Define requirement based on the simulation results with 2 DMRS+
PT_RS (L=1, K=2) configuration, but the final requirements are
applicable for both 2 DMRS+ PT_RS (L=1, K=2) and 3 DMRS + PT_RS (L=1,
K=2)</p>
<p>- Define FRC for 2 DMRS + PT_RS (L=1, K=2)</p>
<p>- Define FRC for 3 DMRS + PT_RS (L=1, K=2)</p>

<p>a) Type B.</p>
<p>6) Length of PUSCH allocation. Align with PUSCH for UL timing
adjustment:</p>
<p>a) Option 1: 10; and</p>
<p>b) Option 2: 9.</p>
<p>7) MSC, Align with PUSCH for UL timing adjustment:</p>
<p>a) Only MCS16 is used.</p>
<p>8) SRS bandwidth configuration:</p>
<p>a) 50MHz CBW (32RBs)~C_SRS =9, B_SRS =0</p>
<p>b) 200MHz CBW (132RBs)~ C_SRS=33, B_SRS=0</p>
<p>9) SRS Transmission comb: K<sub>TC</sub>=2. SRS transmission in UL

<p>11) Slots in which sounding RS is transmitted:</p>
<p>a) The last symbol in slot#3 in radio frames for 120KHz SCS.</p>
<p>It was agreed that the SRS transmission location is the last symbol
in slot#3 in radio frame with TDD pattern as DDDSU, S=10:2:2</p>
<p>12) Test Parameters for timing offset:</p>
<p>a) Option 1: A: 1.25 us and Δw: 1.04 s-1 corresponding to 120KHz SCS
for HST FR2 UL timing adjustment requirements; and</p>
<p>b) Option 2: FFS on A =2.5 us; and</p>
<p>c) Other options are not preluded</p>
<p>RAN4 agreed to use Option 1.</p>
<p>13) Test different between moving UE and stationary UE:</p>
<p>a) Option 1: [Δt-(TA-31)x16*8Tc]. Note: The timing different can be
updated with taken into account the output of possible enhancements for
timing adjustment command discussion in RRM session</p>
<p>RAN4 agreed to apply the timing difference between moving UE and
stationary UE as Δτ-(TA-31)x16*8Tc for UL timing adjustment
requirement</p>
<p>14) The length of PUSCH data is 10</p>

<p>Test setup for PRACH:</p>
<p>1) PRACH format:</p>
<p>- only C2;</p>
<p>- Channel</p>
<p>- AWGN</p>
<p>2) Frequency offset:</p>
<p>a) 19444Hz with 350km/h at 30GHz carrier frequency.</p>
<p>3) Test Preamble Configuration for Ncs. RAN4 agreed to use option 1
as baseline.:</p>
<p>a) Ncs=0</p>
<p>4) Timing offset configuration:</p>
<p>a) Option 1: Reuse Rel-15 FR2 timing offset configuration for PRACH,
i.e., 0.8us; and</p>
<p>b) Option 2: Update the timing offset configuration based on the
largest expected cell radius, i.e., derived from scenario B. Note:</p>
<p>- Scenario A (Ds=700m, Dmin=10m), cell radius = 700m</p>
<p>- Scenario B (Ds=700m, Dmin=150ms), cell radius = 716ms</p>
<p>RAN4 decided to use one timing offset configuration. Configure the
maximum timing offset (i.e., the end of the tested range) in FR2 HST
testing setup equal to 4.8us:</p>
<p>- Value of Timing offset: 0</p>
<p>- Step of Timing offset increase: 0.48us</p>
<p>5) Timing error tolerance:</p>
<p>a) 0.07us for AWGN, as a default value for 120KHz SCS.</p>
