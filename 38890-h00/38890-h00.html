<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>A new SI “Study on NR QoE management and optimizations for diverse
services” was approved for Release 17 at the 3GPP TSG RAN #86 meeting in
[2]. The SI aims to study the potential RAN side solution for supporting
a generic framework for triggering, configuring, collection and
reporting of NR QoE measurement for various 5G use cases.</p>
<h1 id="scope"><br />
1 Scope</h1>
<p>The present document captures the results of study on NR QoE
management and optimizations for diverse services in RP-193256 [2]. It
identifies to study the framework for triggering, configuring,
collection and reporting of NR QoE measurement and study the potential
impact on the related interface (e.g. F1, NG, Xn interface).</p>

and abbreviations</h1>
<h2 id="definitions">3.1 Definitions</h2>
<p>For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].</p>
<p><strong>QoE measurement:</strong> An application layer measurement
configured by OAM, see details in [3] [4] [5] [6] for different service
types.</p>
<p><strong>QoE report:</strong> The result of a QoE measurement.</p>
<p><strong>Radio-related measurements:</strong> Measurements on the
radio layer, whose purpose is to help network to further evaluate and
improve the QoE.</p>
<p><strong>Radio-related information:</strong> Information other than
“radio-related measurements”, e.g. feature info, mobility history info
or dual connectivity status.</p>
<p><strong>RAN-visible QoE:</strong> Includes RAN-visible QoE metrics
and RAN-visible QoE values.</p>
<p><strong>RAN-visible QoE metrics:</strong> A subset of QoE metrics
data collected from UE, which are useful for RAN.</p>
<p><strong>RAN-visible QoE values:</strong> A set of values derived from
QoE metrics data through a model/function defined in collaboration with
SA4.</p>
<p><strong>QoE measurement collection:</strong> Collection of QoE
measurements in the UE.</p>
<p><strong>QoE measurement collection activation:</strong> Initiation of
a QoE measurement collection requested by OAM, associated with an
identifier included in the QoE measurement configuration transmitted to
the UE.</p>
<p><strong>QoE measurement collection triggering:</strong> The
condition(s) configured by OAM, whose fulfilment indicates to the UE
that QoE measurement collection configured by OAM can be activated.</p>
<p><strong>QoE measurement collection deactivation:</strong> Permanent
stopping of a QoE measurement collection of identifiers (previously
configured) requested from OAM transmitted to the UE, resulting in QoE
measurement configuration release in the UE.</p>
<p><strong>QoE measurement reporting:</strong> Delivery of the QoE
report resulted from QoE measurement collection from the UE to the
RAN.</p>
<p><strong>QoE measurement reporting pause:</strong> An action resulting
in temporary stopping of QoE measurement reporting, where the QoE
measurement collection is not affected.</p>
<p><strong>QoE measurement reporting resume:</strong> An action
resulting in resumption of a previously paused QoE measurement
reporting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: The above definitions may need further adaptation, to align
with SA5 and RAN2.</p>
<p>NOTE: The handling of RAN-visible measurement collection activation,
triggering and deactivation, as well as RAN-visible QoE reporting pause
and resume can be defined in normative phase.</p>

<p>NR QoE takes LTE QoE solution as baseline, where LTE QoE solution
includes the following key parts:</p>
<p>- Both signalling based and management based initiated cases are
allowed.</p>
<p>- The LTE QoE feature is activated by Trace Function.</p>
<p>- Application layer measurement configuration received from OAM or CN
can be encapsulated in a transparent container, which is forwarded to UE
in a downlink RRC message. Application layer measurements received from
UE’s higher layer can be encapsulated in a transparent container and
sent to network in an uplink RRC message.</p>
<h1 id="g-services-qoe-metrics-and-ue-kpi-information">5 5G services,
QoE metrics and UE KPI information</h1>
<p>NR QoE supports the Application Layer Measurement Collection
functionality.</p>
<p>This functionality enables the collection of application layer
measurements from the UE. The supported service types include:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Streaming services [3];</p>
<p>- MTSI services [4];</p>
<p>- VR [5];</p>
<p>- MBMS [6];</p>
<p>- XR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Support for additional service types is not precluded.</p>
<p>In addition to the QoE metrics, the radio related measurements and
information to assist the NR QoE management functionality are
considered.</p>

solutions and procedures</h1>
<h2 id="signalling-based-procedures">6.1 Signalling-based
procedures</h2>
<h3 id="signalling-based-activation-procedure">6.1.1 Signalling-based
activation procedure</h3>
<p>The procedure is used for activating the QoE measurement configured
by OAM and triggered by CN shown in Figure 6.1.1-1.</p>
<p>The CN initiates the activation of the QoE measurement configured by
OAM, and sends the QoE measurement configuration to the NG-RAN node. UE
AS layer sends the QoE measurement configuration to UE application
layer.</p>
<p>Configuration and Reporting for multiple simultaneous QoE
measurements for a UE can be supported.</p>
<p>UE application layer generates the QoE report and sends it to the UE
AS layer. UE AS layer sends the QoE report to NG-RAN node via a separate
SRB (separate from current SRBs) in NR, as this reporting is lower
priority than other SRB transmissions. Then the NG-RAN node transmits
the QoE report to the final destination configured (e.g. TCE/MCE).</p>
<p>RRC segmentation may be needed for transmission of QoE reports, and
any potential solutions need detailed technical specification of the
procedures.</p>
<p>Management based QoE configuration should not override signalling
based QoE configuration.</p>

by OAM and triggered by CN shown in Figure 6.1.2-1.</p>
<p>The CN initiates the deactivation of QoE measurement, as configured
by OAM, and sends the deactivation indication to the NG-RAN node to
indicate which QoE measurement should be deactivated. The NG-RAN node
sends the deactivation indication to the UE AS layer, and then the UE AS
layer sends the deactivation indication to the UE application layer.</p>

<h3 id="management-based-activation-procedure">6.2.1 Management-based
activation procedure</h3>
<p>The procedure is used for activating the QoE measurement configured
and triggered by OAM shown in Figure 6.2.1-1.</p>
<p>The OAM sends the QoE measurement configuration to NG-RAN node.
NG-RAN finds multiple qualified Ues that meet the criteria (e.g. area
scope, application layer capability, service type, etc.) or a single
specific UE. NG-RAN node sends the QoE measurement configuration to the
AS layer of the specific UE or each qualified UE. UE AS layer sends the
QoE measurement configuration to UE application layer. When a session
starts, the application layer in UE checks the criteria (e.g. cell list,
service type, etc.), and, if the criteria are met, starts QoE
measurement and reporting.</p>
<p>Configuration and Reporting for multiple simultaneous QoE
measurements for a UE can be supported.</p>
<p>In case multiple QoE measurements are configured at a UE, it can be
discussed in the normative phase whether one measurement is configured
per service type at the UE.</p>
<p>UE application layer sends the QoE report to the UE AS layer. UE AS
layer sends the QoE report to NG-RAN node via a separate SRB (separate
from current SRBs) in NR, as this reporting is lower priority than other
SRB transmissions. Then the NG-RAN node transmits the QoE report to the
final destination configured (e.g. the MCE).</p>
<p>RRC segmentation may be needed for transmission of QoE reports, and
any potential solutions need detailed technical specification of the
procedures.</p>
<p>Management based QoE configuration should not override signalling
based QoE configuration.</p>
<p>Regarding Management-based configuration towards an individual
specific UE, the following needs to be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The OAM is currently not capable of sending the QoE measurement
configuration for a specific UE towards its serving gNB when the
targeted UE becomes RRC_CONNECTED. This is because OAM is not informed
about when a specific Ues served by a certain gNB become
RRC_CONNECTED.</p></li>
<li><p>There is currently no UE identifier available in OAM which can be
used to identify an UE connected to a certain gNB.</p></li>
<li><p>Although it is acknowledged that QoE measurement configuration
towards an individual specific UE is already possible using signalling
based configuration (via the CN), it should be noted that OAM can issue
per-user policies for which the feedback in terms of user experience is
required.</p></li>

<h2 id="qoe-measurement-triggering-and-stopping">6.3 QoE measurement
triggering and stopping</h2>
<p>QoE measurement triggering and stopping can be realized using
time-based and/or threshold-based criteria, configured by the OAM.
Time-based QoE measurement triggering and stopping in NR is achieved by
reusing mechanisms specified in LTE for the start and stop of QoE
measurements. Threshold-based QoE measurement triggering and stopping
allows to start and stop QoE measurement when given thresholds are
passed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, RAN is not allowed to intervene, i.e. pause, activate or
de-activate an ongoing QoE measurement collection unless instructed
otherwise by the OAM.</p>
<h2 id="release-of-qoe-measurement-configuration">6.4 Release of QoE
measurement configuration </h2>
<p>An NG-RAN node can issue a release of QoE measurement configuration
for Ues previously configured for QoE measurement reporting, provided
that the session for which the QoE measurements are reported is
completed.</p>
<p>RAN may need to release an ongoing QoE measurement configuration or
QoE reporting configuration, e.g. if handing over to a network that does
not support this.</p>
<h2 id="qoe-measurement-handling-at-ran-overload">6.5 QoE measurement
handling at RAN overload</h2>
<p>In case of RAN overload in standalone connectivity, RAN can stop new
QoE measurement configurations, release existing QoE measurement
configurations and pause QoE measurement reporting. RRC signaling is
used by the gNB to indicate the UE to pause or resume the QoE reporting.
Potential solutions of pause/resume mechanism need detailed technical
specification of the procedures, e.g. pause/resume for all QoE reports
or pause/resume per QoE configuration, how long can the UE store the
reports, limit for stored reports size etc.</p>
<p>The details of QoE measurement handling at RAN overload in dual
connectivity might be discussed in normative phase.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-mobility">6.6 Support for Mobility </h2>
<p>Seamless mobility is a key functionality in NR and its impacts should
be measurable at the application layer. To enable measuring the impact
of the mobility on the application and users’ QoE, it is required to
support QoE measurement reporting continuity in intra-system intra-RAT
intra-node and inter-node mobility scenarios: for intra-node mobility
for both management-based and signalling-based QoE. At least
signalling-based QoE supports this also in case of inter-node mobility.
Support for management-based QoE will be discussed in normative phase,
with respect to the “Requirements from SA WGs” below.</p>
<p>In LTE, to support the QoE measurement in mobility scenarios, the QoE
configuration is forwarded from the source eNB to the target eNB inside
the <em>Trace Activation</em> IE over the X2 interface. The same IE is
sent over the S1 interfaces for mobility scenarios when the X2 interface
is not established between the source and the target.</p>
<p>In NR, to support mobility for QoE measurements in RRC_CONNECTED
state, the QoE measurement configuration transfer is supported on the Xn
and NG interfaces, inside the <em>Trace Activation</em> IE as a part of
<em>UE Application Layer Measurement Configuration IE</em> that may
contain multiple QoE configurations for multiple service types. QoE
measurements in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE state can be supported for
MBS. To support keeping QoE measurement configuration in RRC_INACTIVE
state mobility, QoE measurement configuration for a UE can be fetched
from the node hosting the UE Context. Whether UE stores its QoE
configuration when going to RRC_INACTIVE state for potential use when
the UE moves back to RRC_CONNECTED state will be decided in technical
specification of the procedures.</p>
<p>In addition, the SA4 requirements for QoE measurements stipulate that
the client shall check the QoE configuration only when a session starts
(see “Requirements from SA WGs” below). This means that the client shall
continue the QoE measurements for an ongoing session even if the UE
moves out of the configured area. The SA4 requirements are
RAT-independent and shall therefore be applied to the mobility solution
for QoE measurement in NR, as well. QoE measurement reporting continuity
in intra-system inter-RAT mobility scenarios should therefore be
prioritized in Rel-17. QoE measurement reporting continuity in
inter-system mobility scenarios may be handled in Rel-18. Appropriate
action for the case where the target RAT does not support the source RAT
configurations (including QoE configuration) is to be defined in
normative phase in coordination with RAN2. Other issues requiring
clarification in normative phase include how the area scope is
configured to cover inter-RAT mobility, how service continuity is dealt
together with QoE measurements for intra-RAT inter-node mobility, how
the target RAT/system knows if the source side has configured the QoE
measurement for the concerned UE.</p>
<p>For support of MR-DC, a selection between one or more of the
following alternatives may be done in normative phase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Alternative 1: No support – only the MN can configure QoE in the
UE, and QoE measurement reports are sent from the UE to the MN.</p>
<p>- Alternative 2: Flexible QoE configuration, i.e. may be done by
either the MN or the SN.</p>
<p>- Alternative 3: Flexible QoE measurement reporting, i.e. may be done
via either the MN leg or the SN leg (e.g. depending on load situation or
on a need basis).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alternatives 2 and 3 may be combined.</p>
<p>One example use case for MR-DC QoE support is that, for a DC-capable
UE, the RAN may want to determine whether to set up the DC for this UE
or not. For instance, if QoE performance with only one leg set up is
sufficiently good, then setting up the other leg may be unnecessary,
i.e. it would unnecessarily drain the UE’s battery.</p>
<p><strong>Requirements from SA WGs:</strong></p>
<p>LS [7] from SA5 states “<em>It is essential that handover is
supported for QoE measurements</em>”, and refers to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- TS 28.404 <strong>REQ-EUSPC-CON-1:</strong> The operator shall have
a capability to request collection of QoE information per end user
service/end user service type for a specified area. The request may
include an address of a collection centre to which the collected
information shall be delivered.</p>
<p>- TS 26.114 clause 16.3, TS 26.247 clause 10.5 LocationFilter: “When
present, this element indicates the geographic area(s) or location(s)
where quality metric collection is requested.”</p>
<p>- TS 26.114 clause 10.1, TS 26.247 clause 16.3: “The QoE
configuration shall only be checked by the client when each session
starts, and thus all logging and reporting criterias for an ongoing
session shall be unaffected by any QoE configuration changes received
during that session. This also includes evaluation of any filtering
criterias, such as geographical filtering, which shall only be done when
the session starts. Thus changes to the QoE configuration will only
affect sessions started after these configuration changes have been
received.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the time of this study, SA4 has only specified QMC functionality
(for QoE configuration and reporting) for UMTS and LTE [8].</p>
<p>Other references that need to be considered for RAN3’s work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- TS 26.114 clause 16.5.1: “<em>The QoE configuration AT command
+CAPPLEVMC may also indicate with an Within-area Indication if the UE is
inside or outside a wanted geographic area. Such an indication may
arrive with or without any QoE configuration container attached. If the
MTSI client is informed that it is not inside the area, it shall not
start any new QoE measurements even if it has received a valid QoE
configuration container, but shall continue measuring for already
started sessions.</em>” The same behaviour is described for the DASH
client in TS 26.247 annex L.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- TS 26.114 clause 16.5.2 XML configuration: <em>“Note that if
geographical filtering is handled on the network side (i.e. QoE
reporting is turned on/off by the network depending on the UE location),
no LocationFilter should be specified in the QoE Configuration, as this
would mean two consecutive filterings.”</em></p>
<p>To fulfil the SA4 and SA5 QoE requirements of mobility, the details
of Area Handling at mobility shall be addressed in the WI. For the Area
Handling at mobility there are three main options, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Option 1, where the network is responsible for keeping track of
whether the UE is inside or outside the area and configures / releases
configuration accordingly.</p>
<p>- Option 2, where the network is responsible for keeping track of
whether the UE is inside or outside the area, and the UE responsible to
manage start/stop of QoE accordingly.</p>
<p>- Option 3, where the UE is responsible for area checking (UE has the
area configuration) and to manage start/stop of QoE accordingly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mobility procedure adaptation for signalling-based vs.
management-based shall be addressed in the WI.</p>
<h2 id="ran-visible-qoe-information-reporting-by-ue">6.7 RAN visible QoE
information reporting by UE</h2>
<p>The RAN may not be able to understand or make use of the legacy QoE
metrics, as they are assembled by the OAM, sent inside containers and
intended to be processed by the Measurement Collection Entity in the
network. If the RAN needs to make use of the QoE concept, there might be
requirements that QoE information should be visible by the RAN.
RAN-visible QoE information is simplified QoE information abstracted
from QoE metrics by UE, which the RAN may use for various types of
optimizations.</p>
<h3 id="general-principles-and-message-flow">6.7.1 General principles
and message flow</h3>
<p>The RAN-visible QoE metrics can be derived from individual
SA4-defined QoE metrics deemed useful for the RAN, such as buffer level.
RAN-visible QoE metrics may be e.g. be simplified values derived from
individual useful SA4-defined QoE metrics or combinations of these
values. SA4 to be consulted on how the values are derived.</p>
<p>The following holds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- The RAN-visible QoE can be used for all services.</p>
<p>- The RAN is responsible for assembling the RAN-visible QoE
measurement configuration.</p>
<p>- The RAN is responsible for triggering i.e. activating the
RAN-visible QoE measurement.</p>
<p>- Whether the RAN can explicitly ask the UE to report certain
RAN-visible QoE metrics, or just an indication to report the fixed set
of RAN-visible QoE metrics predefined per service type, is to be studied
in the normative phase.</p>
<p>- The RAN should be able to configure RAN-visible QoE autonomously
for a given service type only if the application layer QoE for the same
service type is already configured.</p>
<p>- The RAN-visible QoE value can be generated by UE and QoE
server.</p>
<p>NOTE: RAN generating RAN-visible QoE values requires that RAN reads
the QoE report in XML format, which is left to implementation.</p>
<p>- The RAN-visible QoE values are delivered to the RAN as a separate
IE, visible to the RAN.</p>
<p>- The RAN is not allowed to change the existing configuration of
legacy QoE metrics specified by SA4.</p>
</blockquote>

reporting.</p>

<p>Figure 6.7.1-1: RAN-visible QoE information reporting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. An NG-RAN node assembles and sends the RAN-visible QoE
configuration to a UE, which may be sent along with the QoE measurement
configuration container transmitted from the OAM, directly or via the
CN.</p>
<p>2. The UE receives and applies the RAN-visible QoE configuration
and/or QoE measurement configuration container. The RAN-visible QoE
configuration may be so that the corresponding RAN-visible QoE
information that is reported can be a unique value or a combination of
values reflecting the QoE metrics useful for RAN (such as buffer level).
The RAN-visible report is provided from the application layer of the UE
to the UE’s RRC layer by means of an AT command. The UE’s RRC layer then
includes the RAN-visible report, along with the QoE report container,
but as a separate IE, in the MeasReportAppLayer IE, and sends it to the
RAN.</p>
<p>3. The NG-RAN node reads the RAN-visible QoE information and/or
forwards the (legacy) QoE report container to the QoE server
accordingly. Alternatively, the OAM server may generate the RAN-visible
QoE report and send it to the RAN.</p>

Radio-related measurements and information for QoE </h2>
<p>In order for the network to further evaluate and improve the QoE, the
RAN could also trigger radio-related measurements towards a certain UE,
based on the QoE measurement configuration received from the OAM. For
triggering the measurements, an existing mechanism, e.g. MDT procedure,
can be used. Collection of radio related measurements, if needed, should
be done by existing methods such as MDT, if the UE supports MDT in
R17.</p>
<p>The radio-related QoE measurements are reported for all types of
supported services, and they include MDT-like measurements and,
potentially, additional measurements related to the radio interface. If
new radio-related measurements, with respect to what is currently
specified in MDT, are required for NR QoE management, these additional
radio-related QoE measurements will be specified as a part of MDT
measurements. Application-related QoE measurements are only collected
when the application session is ongoing. If these radio-related
measurements are used for assisting application-related QoE
measurements, it is beneficial and efficient if measurement collection
and reporting can start at the same time. If configured together e.g.
using same trace reference and time aligned, e.g. based on time stamps,
correlation of the results may be done by post processing. Besides
radio-related measurement results, radio-related information may also be
reported. Radio-related information may be reported even when
radio-related measurements are not triggered over the radio.</p>
<p>Both of the radio-related measurement results and radio-related
information, if reported, should be aligned and correlated with the QoE
report, using e.g. trace ID.</p>

(S-NSSAI) and attach it in the QoE report.</p>
<p>6. The NG-RAN node forwards the QoE report with slice ID to the
MCE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution 2</strong></p>
<p>Example of sequence or steps of the solution are listed below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. The OAM/CN transmits the QoE measurement configuration to the
NG-RAN node, including Slice Scope.</p>
<p>2. The NG-RAN node checks the Slice Scope with all of the ongoing PDU
sessions and sends QoE measurement configuration to a UE with qualified
PDU session, including Slice Scope.</p>
<p>3. The UE receives the QoE measurement configuration and sends it to
the corresponding application layer according to the Slice Scope.
Whether Application layer or AS layer performs the mapping can be
discussed at normative stage.</p>
<p>4. The UE sends the QoE report with slice ID to the NG-RAN node.</p>
<p>5. The NG-RAN node forwards the QoE report with slice ID to the
MCE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For solution 2, Slice Scope may be inside of the QoE configuration
container defined by SA4 and further confirmation with SA4 is
needed.</p>
<p>For the case of same service type with different slice ID, detailed
solution might need confirmation from other working groups.</p>
<p><strong>Solution 3</strong></p>
<p>Example of sequence or steps of the solution are listed below:</p>
<p>1. The OAM/CN transmits the QoE measurement configuration to the
NG-RAN node, including the associated slice ID, outside the QoE
configuration container, i.e. visible to the RAN.</p>
<p>2. The NG-RAN node checks the slice ID against the ongoing PDU
sessions, and sends QoE measurement configuration to a UE with qualified
PDU session, including slice ID.</p>
<p>3. The UE receives the QoE measurement configuration and performs QoE
measurements.</p>
<p>4. The UE sends the QoE report to the NG-RAN node and adds the slice
ID outside the QoE report container.</p>
<p>5. The NG-RAN node forwards the QoE report with slice ID to the
MCE.</p>
<p>6. For the case of same service type with different slice ID,
detailed solution might need confirmation from other working groups</p>
<p>For all above solutions, Slice Scope is outside of the QoE
configuration container, which defined by SA4, and also needs
confirmation with SA5. Slice Scope is applied for all configured Area
scope.</p>
<p>For signalling-based QoE, Slice Scope (e.g. list of S-NSSAIs) should
be transmitted to the target gNB during mobility.</p>
<p>For management-based QoE, Slice Scope can be clarified in normative
stage.</p>

<p>Potential impacts on RAN2 specifications.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- RRC signalling definition for QoE configuration and reporting,
including aspects related to SRBs and multiple QoE configurations</p>
<p>- RRC signalling definition for RAN overload handling, e.g.
pause/resume/release procedures</p>
<p>- RRC impact related to mobility handling for signalling-based and
management-based QoE</p>
<p>- RRC signalling and procedures for handling QoE measurements in
RRC_IDLE/ RRC_INACTIVE state</p>
<p>- RRC signalling and procedure definition for RAN-visible QoE
configuration and reporting (the specification impact depends on the
exact solution)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="conclusion">8 Conclusion</h1>
<p>The following features are recommended by RAN3 to be specified in
Rel-17 normative phase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Signalling-based activation/deactivation</p>
<p>- Management-based activation/deactivation</p>
<p>- QoE measurement handling at RAN overload</p>
<p>- Multiple QMC support</p>
<p>- QoE continuity for intra-RAT mobility</p>
<p>- QoE measurement in RRC_INACTIVE</p>
<p>- RAN visible QoE</p>
<p>- Per-slice QoE measurement</p>
<p>- Alignment of MDT and QoE measurements</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The following features are recommended by RAN3 to be deprioritized in
Rel-17 normative phase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- QoE continuity for Inter-system mobility</p>
<p>- QoE measurement in RRC_IDLE</p>
<p>- QoE continuity for Inter-RAT mobility</p>
<p>- QoE support for MR-DC</p>
