1 Scope</h1>
<p>This document is related to the technical report for this study item
"Scenarios and Requirements for Next Generation Access Technologies"
[1]. The objective of the study item is to identify the typical
deployment scenarios associated with attributes such as carrier
frequency, inter-site distance, user density, maximum mobility speed,
etc, and to develop requirements for next generation access technologies
for the identified deployment scenarios taking into account, but not
limited to, the ITU-R discussion on IMT-2020 requirements.</p>
<p>This document contains scenarios and requirements for next generation
access technologies, which can be used as not only guidance to the
technical work to be performed in 3GPP RAN WGs, but also input for ITU-R
to take into account when developing IMT-2020 technical performance
requirements.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">4 Introduction</h1>
<p>At the 3GPP TSG RAN #70 meeting, the Study Item description on
"Scenarios and Requirements for Next Generation Access Technologies" was
approved [1].</p>
<p>The justification of the Study Item was that a fully mobile and
connected society is expected in the near future, which will be
characterized by a tremendous amount of growth in connectivity, traffic
volume and a much broader range of usage scenarios. Some typical trends
include explosive growth of data traffic, great increase of connected
devices and continuous emergence of new services. Besides the market
requirements, the mobile communication society itself also requires a
sustainable development of the eco-system, which produces the needs to
further improve system efficiencies, such as spectrum efficiency, energy
efficiency, operational efficiency and cost efficiency. To meet the
above ever-increasing requirements from market and mobile communication
society, next generation access technologies are expected to emerge in
the near future. A study item to identify typical deployment scenarios
for next generation access technologies and the required capabilities in
each corresponding deployment scenarios should be considered.</p>
<h1 id="objectives">5 Objectives</h1>
<p>In order to meet the deployment scenarios and requirements, studies
for next generation access technologies should be carried out in at
least, but not limited to, the following areas, designs for next
generation access technologies RAN should strive for enough flexibility
to support current envisaged and future requirements for the different
use cases, e.g., from SA1 3GPP TR 22.891 [3], i.e., to support for wide
range of services.</p>
<h1 id="scenarios">6 Scenarios</h1>
<h2 id="general">6.0 General</h2>
<p>This subsection briefly introduces the three usage scenarios defined
by ITU-R IMT for 2020 and beyond [4] is envisaged to expand and support
diverse families of usage scenarios and applications that will continue
beyond the current IMT. Furthermore, a broad variety of capabilities
would be tightly coupled with these intended different usage scenarios
and applications for IMT for 2020 and beyond. The families of usage
scenarios for IMT for 2020 and beyond include:</p>
<p>- eMBB (enhanced Mobile BroadBand)</p>
<p>- mMTC (massive Machine Type Communications)</p>
<p>- URLLC (Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communications)</p>
<h2 id="deployment-scenarios">6.1 Deployment scenarios</h2>
<p>Deployment scenarios for eMBB, mMTC and URLLC are described in this
TR. Other deployment scenarios related to eV2X (enhanced Vehicle to
Everything) services are also described in this TR. Not all requirements
apply to all deployment scenarios described in the TR. The mapping
between requirements and deployment scenarios is described per KPI in
Chapter 7.However, some of eMBB deployment scenarios may possibly be
reused to evaluate mMTC and URLLC, or some specific evaluation tests
(e.g., link-level simulation) can be developed to check whether the
requirements can be achieved.</p>
<p>High-level descriptions on deployment scenarios including carrier
frequency, aggregated system bandwidth, network layout / ISD, BS / UE
antenna elements, UE distribution / speed and service profile are
proposed in this TR. It is assumed that more detailed attributes and
simulation parameters, for example, the channel model, BS / UE Tx power,
number of antenna ports, etc. should be defined in the new RAT study
item.</p>
<h3 id="indoor-hotspot">6.1.1 Indoor hotspot</h3>
<p>The indoor hotspot deployment scenario focuses on small coverage per
site/TRxP (transmission and reception point) and high user throughput or
user density in buildings. The key characteristics of this deployment
scenario are high capacity, high user density and consistent user
experience indoor.</p>
<p>Some of its attributes are listed in Table 6.1.1-1.</p>

<p>NOTE1: The options noted here are for evaluation purpose, and do not
mandate the deployment of these options or preclude the study of other
spectrum options. A range of bands from 24.25 GHz – 52.6 GHz identified
for WRC-19 are currently being considered and around 30 GHz is chosen as
a proxy for this range. A range of bands from 66 GHz – 86 GHz identified
for WRC-19 are currently being considered and around 70 GHz is chosen as

<p>NOTE2: The aggregated system bandwidth is the total bandwidth
typically assumed to derive the values for some KPIs such as area
traffic capacity and user experienced data rate. It is allowed to
simulate a smaller bandwidth than the aggregated system bandwidth and
transform the results to a larger bandwidth. The transformation method
should then be described, including the modelling of power
limitations.</p>
<p>NOTE3: "DL + UL" refers to either of the following two cases:</p>
<p>1. FDD with symmetric bandwidth allocations between DL and UL.</p>
<p>2. TDD with the aggregated system bandwidth used for either DL or UL
via switching in time-domain.</p>
<p>NOTE4: The maximum number of antenna elements is a working
assumption. 3GPP needs to strive to meet the target with typical antenna
configurations.</p>

<p>The high speed deployment scenario focuses on continuous coverage
along track in high speed trains. The key characteristics of this
scenario are consistent passenger user experience and critical train
communication reliability with very high mobility. In this deployment
scenario, dedicated linear deployment along railway line and the
deployments including SFN scenarios captured in Section 6.2 of 3GPP TR
36.878 [6] are considered, and passenger UEs are located in train
carriages. For the passenger UEs, if the antenna of relay node for
eNB-to-Relay is located at top of one carriage of the train, the antenna
of relay node for Relay-to-UE could be distributed to all carriages.</p>

<p>NOTE1: The carrier frequencies noted here are for evaluation purpose
only, satellites are deployed in wide range of frequency bands including
L band (1-2GHz), S band (2-4GHz), C band (3.4-6.725 GHz), Ku band
(10.7-14.8 GHz), Ka band (17.3-21.2 GHz, 27.0-31.0 GHz) and Q/V bands
(37.5-43.5 GHz, 47.2-50.2 GHz and 50.4-51.4 GHz) and more. Here the

<h1 id="key-performance-indicators">7 Key performance indicators</h1>
<p>This section describes the definitions of all KPIs.</p>
<p>The KPI targets defined in this section as well as in Report ITU-R
M.[IMT-2020. TECH PERF REQ] shall be supported by next generation access
technologies. The evaluation methodology defined in Report ITU-R
M.[IMT-2020.EVAL] shall be used to evaluate the targets specified in
Report ITU-R M.[IMT-2020. TECH PERF REQ].</p>
<h2 id="peak-data-rate">7.1 Peak data rate</h2>
<p>Peak data rate is the highest theoretical data rate which is the
received data bits assuming error-free conditions assignable to a single
mobile station, when all assignable radio resources for the
corresponding link direction are utilised (i.e., excluding radio
resources that are used for physical layer synchronisation, reference
signals or pilots, guard bands and guard times).</p>
<p>The target for peak data rate should be 20Gbps for downlink and
10Gbps for uplink.</p>
<p>Analytical evaluation is used as the evaluation methodology.</p>
<h2 id="peak-spectral-efficiency">7.2 Peak Spectral efficiency</h2>
<p>Peak spectral efficiency is the highest theoretical data rate
(normalised by bandwidth), which is the received data bits assuming
error-free conditions assignable to a single mobile station, when all
assignable radio resources for the corresponding link direction are
utilised (i.e., excluding radio resources that are used for physical
layer synchronisation, reference signals or pilots, guard bands and
guard times).</p>
<p>The target for peak spectral efficiency should be 30bps/Hz for
downlink and 15bps/Hz for uplink.</p>
<p>Higher frequency bands could have higher bandwidth but lower spectral
efficiency and lower frequency bands could have lower bandwidth but
higher spectral efficiency. Thus, peak data rate cannot be directly
derived from peak spectral efficiency and bandwidth multiplication.</p>
<p>Analytical evaluation is used as the evaluation methodology.</p>
<h2 id="bandwidth">7.3 Bandwidth</h2>
<p>Bandwidth means the maximal aggregated total system bandwidth. It may
be supported by single or multiple RF carriers.</p>
<p>It is a quantitative KPI.</p>
<p>NOTE1: Target value for this KPI is not defined here: it may be
derived by IMT-2020 requirements, or based on outcomes from RAN1/RAN4
study/design.</p>
<h2 id="control-plane-latency">7.4 Control plane latency</h2>
<p>Control plane latency refers to the time to move from a battery
efficient state (e.g., IDLE) to start of continuous data transfer (e.g.,
ACTIVE).</p>
<p>The target for control plane latency should be 10ms.</p>
<p>Analytical evaluation is used as the evaluation methodology.</p>
<p>NOTE1: For satellite communications link, the control plane should be
able to support RTT of up to 600ms in the case of GEO and HEO, up to
180ms in the case of MEO, and up to 50ms in the case of LEO satellite
systems.</p>
<h2 id="user-plane-latency">7.5 User plane latency</h2>
<p>The time it takes to successfully deliver an application layer
packet/message from the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU ingress point to
the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU egress point via the radio interface in
both uplink and downlink directions, where neither device nor Base
Station reception is restricted by DRX.</p>
<p>For URLLC, the target for user plane latency should be 0.5ms for UL,
and 0.5ms for DL. Furthermore, if possible, the latency should also be
low enough to support the use of the next generation access technologies
as a wireless transport technology that can be used within the next
generation access architecture.</p>
<p>NOTE1: The reliability KPI also provides a latency value with an
associated reliability requirement. The value above should be considered
an average value and does not have an associated high reliability
requirement.</p>
<p>For eMBB, the target for user plane latency should be 4ms for UL, and
4ms for DL.</p>
<p>NOTE2: For eMBB value, the evaluation needs to consider all typical
delays associated with the transfer of the data packets in an efficient
way (e.g. applicable procedural delay when resources are not
preallocated, averaged HARQ retransmission delay, impacts of network
architecture).</p>
<p>When a satellite link is involved in the communication with a user
equipment, the target for user plane RTT can be as high as 600ms for GEO
satellite systems, up to 180ms for MEO satellite systems, and up to 50ms
for LEO satellite systems.</p>
<p>NOTE3: For the satellite case, the evaluation needs to consider the
max RTT that is associated with the GEO satellite systems.</p>
<p>Analytical evaluation is used as the evaluation methodology.</p>
<h2 id="latency-for-infrequent-small-packets">7.6 Latency for infrequent
small packets</h2>
<p>For infrequent application layer small packet/message transfer, the
time it takes to successfully deliver an application layer
packet/message from the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU ingress point at
the mobile device to the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU egress point in
the RAN, when the mobile device starts from its most "battery efficient"
state.</p>
<p>For the definition above, the latency shall be no worse than 10
seconds on the uplink for a 20 byte application packet (with
uncompressed IP header corresponding to 105 bytes physical layer)
measured at the maximum coupling loss (MaxCL) of 164dB.</p>
<p>Analytical evaluation is the baseline evaluation methodology and
system level evaluation can be considered if needed.</p>
<h2 id="mobility-interruption-time">7.7 Mobility interruption time</h2>
<p>Mobility interruption time means the shortest time duration supported
by the system during which a user terminal cannot exchange user plane
packets with any base station during transitions.</p>
<p>The target for mobility interruption time should be 0ms.</p>
<p>This KPI is for both intra-frequency and inter-frequency mobility for
intra-NR mobility.</p>
<p>Mobility support can be relaxed for extreme rural scenarios for the
Provision of minimal services for very low-ARPU areas: Inter RAT
mobility functions can be removed. Intra-RAT mobility functions can be
simplified if it helps decreasing the cost of infrastructure and
devices. Basic idle mode mobility shall be supported as a minimum.</p>
<p>Analytical evaluation is used as the evaluation methodology.</p>
<h2 id="inter-system-mobility">7.8 Inter-system mobility</h2>
<p>Inter-system mobility refers to the ability to support mobility
between the IMT-2020 system and at least one IMT system.</p>
<p>Evaluation methodology is based on inspection for this KPI.</p>
<h2 id="reliability">7.9 Reliability</h2>
<p>Reliability can be evaluated by the success probability of
transmitting X bytes within a certain delay, which is the time it takes
to deliver a small data packet from the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU
ingress point to the radio protocol layer 2/3 SDU egress point of the
radio interface, at a certain channel quality (e.g., coverage-edge).</p>
<p>A general URLLC reliability requirement for one transmission of a
packet is 1-10<sup>-5</sup> for 32 bytes with a user plane latency of
1ms.</p>
<p>For eV2X, for communication availability and resilience and user
plane latency of delivery of a packet of size 300 bytes, the
requirements are as follows:</p>
<p>- Reliability = 1-10<sup>-5</sup>, and user plane latency = 3-10
msec, for direct communication via sidelink and communication range of
(e.g., a few meters)</p>
<p>- Reliability = 1-10<sup>-5</sup>, and user plane latency = 3-10
msec, when the packet is relayed via BS.</p>
<p>Note that target communication range and reliability requirement is
dependent of deployment and operation scenario (e.g., the average
inter-vehicle speed).</p>
<p>Link level evaluation with deployment scenario specific operating
point and system level simulation are to be performed for the
evaluations of Indoor Hotspot, Urban Macro, Highway, and Urban grid for
connected car.</p>
<p>NOTE1: Other reliability requirements may be added, if needed, e.g.
for critical communications relating to high-speed train, and more
detailed requirements for eV2X should refer to the SA1 requirements in
3GPP TS 22.886 [18].</p>
<h2 id="coverage">7.10 Coverage</h2>
<p>MaxCL in uplink and downlink between device and Base Station site
(antenna connector(s)) for a data rate of 160bps, where the data rate is
observed at the egress/ingress point of the radio protocol stack in
uplink and downlink.</p>
<p>The target for coverage should be 164dB.</p>
<p>Link budget and/or link level analysis are used as the evaluation
methodology.</p>
<h3 id="extreme-coverage">7.10.1 Extreme Coverage</h3>
<p>The coupling loss is defined as the total long-term channel loss over
the link between the UE antenna ports and the eNode B antenna ports, and
includes in practice antenna gains, path loss, shadowing, body loss,
etc. The MaxCL is the limit value of the coupling loss at which the
service can be delivered, and therefore defines the coverage of the
service. The MaxCL is independent of the carrier frequency. It is
defined in the UL and DL as:</p>
<p>- UL MaxCL = UL Max Tx power - eNB Sensitivity</p>
<p>- DL MaxCL = DL Max Tx power - UE Sensitivity</p>
<p>The MaxCL is evaluated via link budget analysis (supported by link
level simulations). The proposed MaxCL calculation template is given in
following table 7.10.1-1:</p>

<p>For a basic MBB service characterized by a downlink datarate of 2Mbps
and an uplink datarate of 60kbps for stationary users, the target on
maximum coupling loss is 140dB. For mobile users a downlink datarate of
384kbps is acceptable.</p>
<p>For a basic MBB service characterized by a downlink datarate of 1Mbps
and an uplink datarate of 30kbps for stationary users, the target on
maximum coupling loss is 143dB. At this coupling loss relevant downlink
and uplink control channels should also perform adequately.</p>
<p>As the evaluation methodology, link budget and/or link level analysis
are used for extreme long distance coverage in low density areas.</p>
<h2 id="ue-battery-life">7.11 UE battery life</h2>
<p>UE battery life can be evaluated by the battery life of the UE
without recharge. For mMTC, UE battery life in extreme coverage shall be
based on the activity of mobile originated data transfer consisting of
200bytes UL per day followed by 20bytes DL from MaxCL of 164dB, assuming
a stored energy capacity of 5Wh.</p>
<p>The target for UE battery life for mMTC should be beyond 10 years, 15
years is desirable.</p>
<p>Analytical evaluation is used as the evaluation methodology.</p>
<h2 id="ue-energy-efficiency">7.12 UE energy efficiency</h2>
<p>UE energy efficiency means the capability of a UE to sustain much
better mobile broadband data rate while minimizing the UE modem energy
consumption.</p>
<p>It is a qualitative KPI</p>
<p>Evaluation methodology should be based on inspection. More detailed
quantitative assessment can be performed.</p>
<h2 id="celltransmission-pointtrxp-spectral-efficiency">7.13
Cell/Transmission Point/TRxP spectral efficiency</h2>
<p>TRxP spectral efficiency NOTE1 is defined as the aggregate throughput
of all users (the number of correctly received bits, i.e. the number of
bits contained in the service data units (SDUs) delivered to Layer 3,
over a certain period of time) divided by the channel bandwidth divided
by the number of TRxPs. A 3 sector site consists of 3 TRxPs. In case of
multiple discontinuous "carriers" (one carrier refers to a continuous
block of spectrum), this KPI should be calculated per carrier. In this
case, the aggregate throughput, channel bandwidth, and the number of
TRxPs on the specific carrier are employed.</p>
<p>It is a quantitative KPI NOTE2</p>
<p>A joint system level evaluation is to be performed for Indoor
Hotspot, Dense Urban, Rural, and Urban Macro.</p>
<p>NOTE1: 3GPP should strive to meet the target with typical antenna

<h2 id="area-traffic-capacity">7.14 Area traffic capacity</h2>
<p>Area traffic capacity means total traffic throughput served per
geographic area (in Mbit/s/m<sup>2</sup>). This metric can be evaluated
by two different traffic models: Full buffer model and Non full buffer
model</p>
<p>- By full buffer model: Total traffic throughput served per
geographic area (in Mbit/s/m<sup>2</sup>). The computation of this
metric is based on full buffer traffic.</p>
<p>- By non full buffer model: Total traffic throughput served per
geographic area (in Mbit/s/m<sup>2</sup>). Both the user experienced
data rate and the area traffic capacity need to be evaluated at the same
time using the same traffic model.</p>
<p>The area traffic capacity is a measure of how much traffic a network
can carry per unit area. It depends on site density, bandwidth and
spectrum efficiency. In the case of full buffer traffic and a single
layer single band system, it may be expressed as:</p>
<p>area capacity (bps/m<sup>2</sup>) = site density (site/m<sup>2</sup>)
× bandwidth (Hz) × spectrum efficiency (bps/Hz/site)</p>
<p>In order to improve area traffic capacity, 3GPP can develop standards
with means for high spectrum efficiency. To this end, spectrum
efficiency gains in the order of three times IMT-Advanced are targeted.
Furthermore, 3GPP can develop standards with means for large bandwidth
support. To this end, it is proposed that at least 1GHz aggregated
bandwidth shall be supported.</p>
<p>The available bandwidth and site density NOTE2, which both have a
direct impact on the available area capacity, are however not under
control of 3GPP.</p>
<p>NOTE2: Site here refers to single transmission and reception point
(TRxP).</p>
<p>It is proposed to perform full buffer evaluation, using the spectrum
efficiency results together with assumptions on available bandwidth and
site density in order to derive a quantitative area traffic capacity KPI
for information.</p>
<h2 id="user-experienced-data-rate">7.15 User experienced data rate</h2>
<p>User experienced data rate NOTE1 can be evaluated for non-full buffer
traffic and for full buffer traffic.</p>
<p>NOTE1: Non-full buffer simulations are preferred for the evaluation
of this KPI.</p>
<p>For non-full buffer traffic, user experienced data rate is the
5%-percentile (5%) of the user throughput. User throughput (during
active time) is defined as the size of a burst divided by the time
between the arrival of the first packet of a burst and the reception of
the last packet of the burst.</p>
<p>For full buffer traffic, user experienced data rate is calculated
as:</p>
<p>user experienced data rate = 5% user spectrum efficiency ×
bandwidth</p>
<p>Here it should be noted that the 5% user spectrum efficiency depends
on the number of active users sharing the channel (assumed to be 10 in
the ITU evaluations ITU-R report M.2135 [5]), and that the 5% user
spectrum efficiency for a fixed transmit power may vary with bandwidth.
To keep a high 5% user spectrum efficiency and a few users sharing the
channel, a dense network is beneficial, i.e. 5% user spectrum efficiency
may vary also with site density (Site here refers to single TRxP).</p>
<p>To improve user experienced data rates, 3GPP can develop standards
with means for high 5% user spectrum efficiency. To this end, 5% user
spectrum efficiency gains in the order of three times IMT-Advanced are
proposed. Furthermore, 3GPP can develop standards with means for large
bandwidth support. To this end, it is proposed that at least 1GHz
aggregated bandwidth shall be supported.</p>
<p>The available bandwidth and site density, which both have a strong
impact on the available user experienced data rates, are however not
under control of 3GPP.</p>
<p>Based on this, the full buffer experienced user data rate is
evaluated for information without numerical requirements.</p>
<p>For non-full buffer evaluation, a joint system level evaluation is to
be performed for Indoor Hotspot, Dense Urban, Rural, and Urban Macro.
The non-full buffer user experienced data rate target is applicable at a
certain area traffic level.</p>
<h2 id="th-percentile-user-spectrum-efficiency">7.16 5th percentile user
spectrum efficiency</h2>
<p>5th percentile user spectrum efficiency means the 5% point of the
cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the normalized user
throughput. The (normalized) user throughput is defined as the average
user throughput (the number of correctly received bits by users, i.e.,
the number of bits contained in the SDU delivered to Layer 3, over a
certain period of time, divided by the channel bandwidth and is measured
in bit/s/Hz. The channel bandwidth for this purpose is defined as the
effective bandwidth times the frequency reuse factor, where the
effective bandwidth is the operating bandwidth normalised appropriately
considering the uplink/downlink ratio. In case of multiple discontinuous
“carriers” (one carrier refers to a continuous block of spectrum), this
KPI should be calculated per carrier. In this case, the user throughput
and channel bandwidth on the specific carrier are employed.</p>
<p>It is a quantitative KPI NOTE1</p>
<p>A joint system level evaluation is to be performed for Indoor
Hotspot, Dense Urban, Rural, and Urban Macro.</p>

<p>Connection density refers to total number of devices fulfilling a

packet failed to be successfully received by destination receiver beyond
packet dropping timer.</p>
<p>The target for connection density should be 1 000 000

discussion in RAN WGs:</p>
<p>- the IMEC model can be used as a starting point with possible
enhancements or adjustment depending on considerations brought to RAN
WGs. Similar other models are not precluded (Further discussion in RAN
WGs needed). Other alternative models can be considered in RAN1 if
needed.</p>
<p>- Energy Efficiency Quantitative KPI should be evaluated by means of
system level simulations at least in 2 deployment scenarios: one
coverage limited environment (ex : Rural) AND one capacity limited
environment (ex : Urban).</p>
<p>- Evaluation should not be for peak hour but based on a 24 hour daily
traffic profile. We recommend that at least 3 load levels should be
evaluated</p>
<p>- Cooling system impact on EE will not be discussed in 3GPP RAN</p>
<p>Evaluation methodology is based on inspection as baseline and system
level evaluation is to be performed if necessary. For system level
evaluation, at least 2 deployment scenarios are considered; one is
coverage limited environment (ex: Rural) and the other one is capacity
limited environment (ex: Dense Urban). NOTE1</p>
<p>NOTE1: Inspection is the method to qualitatively check the capability
of the RAN to improve area traffic capacity with minimum RAN energy
consumption, e.g., ensure no or limited increase of BS power with more
antenna elements and larger bandwidth, etc. As qualitative evaluation,
3GPP should ensure that the new RAT is based on energy efficient design
principles. For quantitative evaluation, one can compare the quantity of
information bits transmitted to/received from users, divided by the
energy consumption of RAN.</p>

<p>The New RAT should be able to support flexible allocation of
resources (e.g. time, frequency) between the new RAT and LTE operating
in the same block of spectrum (with possible bandwidths overlap).
Resource allocation granularity in the time/frequency domain, as well as
the potential guards between NR and LTE resources are to be determined
by the study on the new RAT. The New RAT should be able to use these
resources at least for downlink, uplink and sidelink. The solution
should work whether LTE is supported by the same base station as the New
RAT or the two RATs are supported by different base stations. The
solution should not affect backward compatibility with legacy LTE
terminals. These requirements are applicable for LTE Rel-8 and onwards,
including NB-IoT.</p>
<p>This flexible allocation of resources should enable a progressive
downsize of operators assigned bandwidth used by LTE, and the
corresponding increase in the bandwidth used by NR.</p>
<p>Note: this requirement may be supported with different levels of
flexibility depending on the LTE capability/release.</p>

in the same band in the same geographical area, including collocated

<h2 id="cost-related-requirements">10.10 Cost-related requirements</h2>
<h3 id="balance-of-complexity-and-performance">10.10.1 Balance of
complexity and performance</h3>
<p>The cost of introduction of massive MIMO technology is impacted by
the analog parts, which are directly related with RF performance
requirements. Since massive MIMO is seen as a key technology for NR, the
requirements levels must be chosen carefully and careful consideration
of how they are defined must be undertaken, in order to enable
economically viable deployments. This applies for all types of NR
deployments, but is of particular importance for massive MIMO nodes
employing Active Antenna Systems, or Advanced Antenna Systems in a more
general sense.</p>
<p>In particular, some RF requirements may need more careful
consideration, such as the out of band emission limits and the maximum
ratio between overall system power and individual power per RF
chain/antenna element. In addition to the implied complexity and cost,
the RF requirements must be defined with co-existence and sharing
performance in mind and respecting regulatory limits. Particular care
has to be taken in how to define unwanted emission limits with respect
to the increasing size of the massive MIMO configuration in a proper way
that does not lead to excessively high unwanted emission.</p>
