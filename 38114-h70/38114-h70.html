<h1 id="scope">1 Scope</h1>
<p>The present document covers the assessment of repeater and ancillary
equipment in respect of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).</p>
<p>The present document specifies the applicable requirements,
procedures, test conditions, performance assessment and performance
criteria for repeater and associated ancillary equipment in the
following categories:</p>
<p>- Repeater equipped with antenna connectors which are possible to be
terminated during EMC testing, meeting the <em>RF repeater type 1-C</em>
RF requirements of TS 38.106 [2], with conformance demonstrated by
compliance to TS 38.115-1 [3].</p>
<p>- Repeater not equipped with antenna connectors, i.e. with antenna
elements radiating during the EMC testing, meeting the <em>RF repeater
type 2-O</em> RF requirements of TS 38.106 [2], with conformance
demonstrated by compliance to TS 38.115-2 [4].</p>
<p>The environment classification used in the present document refers to
the residential, commercial and light industrial environment
classification used in IEC 61000‑6-1 [6], IEC 61000-6-3 [7] and IEC
61000-6-8 [24].</p>
<p>The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level
of compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light
industrial environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases
which may occur in any location but with low probability of
occurrence.</p>

<h2 id="general">4.1 General</h2>
<p>Requirements throughout the EMC specifications are in some cases
defined separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency
ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.106 [2]. RF
repeater is designed to operate in FR1 and FR2-1.</p>
<p>The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in
the corresponding RF repeater conformance testing specification TS
38.115-1 [3] for <em>RF repeater type 1-C</em> or TS 38.115-2 [4] for
<em>RF repeater type 2-O.</em> The test conditions shall be recorded in
the test report.</p>
<p>For Repeater capable of multi-band operation, the requirements in the
present document apply for each supported <em>operating band</em> unless
otherwise stated. <em>Operating bands</em> shall be activated according
to the test configuration in clause 4.5. Tests shall be performed
relating to each type of port and all <em>operating bands</em> shall be
assessed during the tests.</p>
<p>The manufacturer shall declare the supported <em>operating
band(s)</em> according to the list of RF repeater <em>operating
bands</em> defined in TS 38.106 [2].</p>
<p>NOTE 1: NR <em>operating bands</em> for <em>RF</em> <em>repeater type
1-C</em>, are declared by the manufacturer according to the declaration
D.2 specified in TS 38.115-1 [3], table 4.6-1.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: NR <em>operating bands</em> for <em>RF repeater type
2-O,</em> are declared by the manufacturer according to the declaration
D.4 specified in TS 38.115-2 [4], table 4.6-1.</p>
<h2 id="arrangements-for-establishing-a-communication-link">4.2
Arrangements for establishing a communication link</h2>
<p>The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by
setting the NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) to an
appropriate number, as defined in TS 38.106 [2], clause 5.3.1.2.</p>
<p>A communication link shall be set up with a suitable test system
capable of evaluating the required performance criteria (hereafter
called "the test system") at the radio interface and
<em>telecommunication port(s)</em> (the BS interface). The test system
shall be located outside of the test environment.</p>
<p>When the EUT is required to be in the uplink/downlink operation, the
following conditions shall be met:</p>
<p>- For the <em>RF repeater type 1-C</em> , the EUT shall be commanded
to operate at maximum rated output power;</p>
<p>- For the <em>RF</em> r<em>epeater type 2-O</em> testing, the EUT
output power shall be configured as stated in clause 8.1 for emission
test and clause 9.1 for immunity test accordingly;</p>
<p>- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the
unwanted signal on the measuring equipment;</p>
<p>For immunity tests clause 4.3 shall apply and the conditions shall be
as follows.</p>
<h2 id="narrow-band-responses">4.3 Narrow band responses</h2>
<p>Responses on uplink or downlink occurring during the immunity test at
discrete frequencies which are narrow band responses (spurious
responses), are identified by the following method:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- if during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes
outside the specified tolerances (clause 6), it is necessary to
establish whether the deviation is due to a narrow band response or to a
wide band (EMC) phenomenon. Therefore, the test shall be repeated with
the unwanted signal frequency increased, and then decreased by 2 x
BW<sub>Channel</sub> MHz, where BW<sub>Channel</sub> is the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.106 [2], clause 5.3;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- if the deviation disappears in either one or both of the above MHz
offset cases, then the response is considered as a narrow band
response;</p>
<p>- if the deviation does not disappear, this may be due to the fact
that the offset has made the frequency of the unwanted signal correspond
to the frequency of another narrow band response. Under these
circumstances the procedure is repeated with the increase and decrease
of the frequency of the unwanted signal set to 2.5 x
BW<sub>Channel</sub> MHz;</p>
<p>- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or
decreased frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and
therefore an EMC problem and the equipment fails the test.</p>
<p>For immunity test narrow band responses are disregarded.</p>
<p>For EUT capable of multi-band operation, all supported <em>operating
bands</em> shall be considered for narrowband responses.</p>
<h2 id="exclusion-bands">4.4 Exclusion bands</h2>
<p>The <em>exclusion band</em> for RF repeater is the frequency range
over which no tests of radiated immunity are made in UL or DL.</p>
<p>The <em>exclusion band</em> for DL is defined as:</p>
<p>F<sub>DL,low</sub> – Δf<sub>OBUE</sub> &lt; f &lt;
F<sub>DL,high</sub> + Δf<sub>OBUE</sub></p>
<p>Where values of F<sub>DL,low</sub> and F<sub>DL,high</sub> are
defined for each <em>operating band</em> in TS 38.106 [2], clause
5.2.</p>
<p>The <em>exclusion band</em> for UL is defined as:</p>
<p>F<sub>UL,low</sub> – Δf<sub>OBUE</sub> &lt; f &lt;

<p>Where values of F<sub>UL,low</sub> and F<sub>UL,high</sub> are
defined for each <em>operating band</em> in TS 38.106 [2], clause
5.2.</p>
<p>For RF repeater capable of multi-band operation, the total
<em>exclusion band</em> is a combination of the <em>exclusion bands</em>
for each <em>operating band</em> supported by RF repeater.</p>

<h2 id="test-configurations">8.1 Test configurations</h2>
<p>This clause defines the configurations for emission tests as
follows:</p>
<p>- The equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions as
specified in the functional standards;</p>
<p>- The test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;</p>
<p>- If the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to
ancillary equipment, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment
while connected to the minimum configuration of <em>ancillary
equipment</em> necessary to exercise the ports;</p>
<p>- If the equipment has a large number of ports, then a sufficient
number shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to
ensure that all the different types of termination are tested;</p>
<p>- The test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall
be recorded in the test report;</p>
<p>- Ports which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to
an <em>ancillary equipment</em> or to a representative piece of cable
correctly terminated to simulate the input/output characteristics of the
<em>ancillary equipment</em>; in case of <em>RF repeater type 1-C</em>,
<em>antenna port</em>s shall be correctly terminated;</p>
<p>- For <em>RF repeater type 2-O</em> without <em>antenna ports</em>
but intentionally radiating through the <em>antenna array</em>, the
equipment shall be placed in a test setup suitable for the radiated
power;</p>
<p>- Ports which are not connected to cables during normal operation,
e.g. service connectors, programming connectors, temporary connectors
etc. shall not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC
testing. Where cables have to be connected to these ports, or
interconnecting cables have to be extended in length in order to
exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to ensure that the
evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or extension of
these cables;</p>
<p>- The test arrangements for uplink and downlink of the repeater are
described separately for the sake of clarity. However, where possible
the test of the uplink clause and downlink clause of the EUT may be
carried out simultaneously to reduce test time.</p>

<h3 id="radiated-emission-repeater">8.2.1 Radiated emission,
Repeater</h3>
<p>This test is applicable to <em>RF repeater type 1-C</em>. This test
shall be performed on a representative configuration of repeater.</p>
<p>For <em>RF repeater type 2-O</em>, the radiated emission is covered
by radiated spurious emission requirement in TS 38.106 [2], conforming
to the test requirement in TS 38.115-2 [4].</p>
<h4 id="definition">8.2.1.1 Definition</h4>
<p>This test assesses the ability of repeater to limit unwanted emission
from the <em>enclosure port</em>.</p>
<h4 id="test-method">8.2.1.2 Test method</h4>
<p>a) A test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM.329 [19] shall
be used. The repeater shall be placed on a non-conducting support and
shall be operated from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation
from the power leads. One of the following two alternative measurement
methods shall be used:</p>
<p>1) Field strength method measurement</p>
<p>The test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 32 [5]. The field
strength measurements shall be performed on a test site that is
validated according to the methods and requirements of CISPR 16-1-4
[25].</p>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, measurements are conducted at 3 m or 10 m on
an open area test site (OATS) or semi anechoic chamber (SAC) for
frequencies up to 1 GHz, or at 3 m on a free space open area test site
(FSOATS) or fully-anechoic room (FAR) for frequencies above 1 GHz.
Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done with RMS detector and
with the -3 dB bandwidth of the measuring filter equal to the reference
bandwidth in table 8.2.1.3-1.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Test site validation methods for radiated emissions tests are
defined in CISPR 16-1-4 [25], clause 6 and 7. Examples of test site
validation methods are listed below:</p>
<p>- 30 - 1000 MHz frequency range: Normalized Site Attenuation (NSA),
Reference Site Method (RSM).</p>
<p>- 1 - 18 GHz frequency range: S<sub>VSWR</sub> standard test
procedure, S<sub>VSWR</sub> reciprocal test procedure.</p>
<p>2) Substitution method measurement (also called a substitution
method)</p>
<p>Mean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test
antenna and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each
frequency at which a component is detected, the repeater shall be
rotated and the height of the test antenna adjusted to obtain maximum
response, and the effective radiated power (e.r.p.) of that component
determined by a substitution measurement. The measurement shall be
repeated with the test antenna in the orthogonal polarization plane.
Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done as mean power
(RMS).</p>
<p>NOTE 2: Effective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of
a half wave tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a
constant difference of 2.15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p, as defined in
ITU-R SM.329 annex 1 [19].</p>
<p>e.r.p. (dBm) = EIRP (dBm) − 2.15</p>
<p>b) The repeater shall transmit with maximum power declared by the
manufacturer with all transmitters active. Set the repeater to transmit
a signal as stated in clause 4.5.</p>
<p>c) The received power shall be measured over the frequency range from
30 MHz to F<sub>DL,low</sub> - Δf<sub>OBUE</sub> and from
F<sub>DL,high</sub> + Δf<sub>OBUE</sub> up to 12750 MHz. For some
<em>operating bands</em>, the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in
order to comply with the 5<sup>th</sup> harmonic limit of the downlink
<em>operating band</em>, as specified in ITU-R SM.329 [19]. The video
bandwidth shall be approximately three times the resolution bandwidth.
If this video bandwidth is not available on the measuring receiver, it
shall be the maximum available and at least 1 MHz. Unless otherwise
stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).</p>
<h4 id="limits">8.2.1.3 Limits</h4>
<p>The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed
transitions of the limits between the requirements for out of band
emissions and spurious emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations
SM.329 [19] and SM.1539-1 [26].</p>
