<p>NG-RAN supports Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) operation
whereby a UE in RRC_CONNECTED is configured to utilise radio resources
provided by two distinct schedulers, located in two different NG-RAN
nodes connected via a non-ideal backhaul, one providing NR access and
the other one providing either E-UTRA or NR access. Further details of

indicates a TAC and a Cell Identity for each subset of PLMNs, PNI-NPNs
and SNPNs. NR access provides only one TAC and one Cell Identity per
cell per PLMN, SNPN or PNI-NPN. In this version of the specification, a
Cell Identity can only belong to one network type among PLMN, PNI-NPN or

<h2 id="integrated-access-and-backhaul">4.7 Integrated Access and
Backhaul</h2>
<h3 id="architecture">4.7.1 Architecture</h3>
<p>Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) enables wireless relaying in
NG-RAN. The relaying node, referred to as <em>IAB-node</em>, supports
access and backhauling via NR. The terminating node of NR backhauling on
network side is referred to as the <em>IAB-donor</em>, which represents
a gNB with additional functionality to support IAB. Backhauling can
occur via a single or via multiple hops. The IAB architecture is shown
in Figure 4.7.1-1.</p>
<p>The IAB-node supports the gNB-DU functionality, as defined in TS
38.401 [4], to terminate the NR access interface to UEs and next-hop
IAB-nodes, and to terminate the F1 protocol to the gNB-CU functionality,
as defined in TS 38.401 [4], on the IAB-donor. The gNB-DU functionality
on the IAB-node is also referred to as <em>IAB-DU</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to the gNB-DU functionality, the IAB-node also supports a
subset of the UE functionality referred to as <em>IAB-MT</em>, which
includes, e.g., physical layer, layer-2, RRC and NAS functionality to
connect to the gNB-DU of another IAB-node or the IAB-donor, to connect
to the gNB-CU on the IAB-donor, and to the core network.</p>
<p>The IAB-node can access the network using either SA mode or EN-DC. In
EN-DC, the IAB-node connects via E-UTRA to a MeNB, and the IAB-donor
terminates X2-C as SgNB (TS 37.340 [21]).</p>
<p><img src="media/image11.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4.7.1-1: IAB architecture; a) IAB-node using SA mode with 5GC;
b) IAB-node using EN-DC</p>
<p>All IAB-nodes that are connected to an IAB-donor via one or multiple
backhaul hops and controlled by this IAB-donor via F1AP and/or RRC form
an IAB topology with the IAB-donor as its root (Fig. 4.7.1-2). In this
IAB topology, the neighbour node of the IAB-DU or the IAB-donor-DU is
referred to as the <em>child</em> node and the neighbour node of the
IAB-MT is referred to as the <em>parent</em> node. The direction toward
the child node is referred to as <em>downstream</em> while the direction
toward the parent node is referred to as <em>upstream</em>. The
IAB-donor performs centralized resource, topology and route management
for its IAB topology.</p>

<h3 id="protocol-stacks">4.7.2 Protocol Stacks</h3>
<p>Fig. 4.7.2-1 shows the protocol stack for F1-U and Fig. 4.7.2-2 shows
the protocol stack for F1-C between IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU. In these
figures, F1-U and F1-C are carried over two backhaul hops.</p>
<p>F1-U and F1-C use an IP transport layer between IAB-DU and
IAB-donor-CU as defined in TS 38.470 [32]. F1-U and F1-C need to be
security-protected as described in TS 33.501 [5] (the security layer is
not shown in the Figures 4.7.2-1/2).</p>
<p>On the wireless backhaul, the IP layer is carried over the Backhaul
Adaptation Protocol (BAP) sublayer, which enables routing over multiple
hops. The IP layer can also be used for <em>non</em>-F1 traffic, such as
OAM traffic as defined in TS 38.401 [4].</p>
<p>On each backhaul link, the BAP PDUs are carried by BH RLC channels.
Multiple BH RLC channels can be configured on each BH link to allow
traffic prioritization and QoS enforcement. The BH-RLC-channel mapping
for BAP PDUs is performed by the BAP entities on each IAB-node and the
IAB-donor-DU.</p>
<p>Protocol stacks for an IAB-donor with split gNB architecture are
specified in TS 38.401 [4].</p>

<p>The IAB-MT further establishes SRBs (carrying RRC and NAS) with the
IAB-donor-CU. For IAB-nodes operating in EN-DC, the IAB-MT establishes
one or more DRBs with the eNB and one or more DRBs with the
IAB-donor-CU, which can be used, e.g., to carry OAM traffic. For SA
mode, the establishment of DRBs is optional. These SRBs and DRBs are
transported between the IAB-MT and its parent node over Uu access
channel(s). The protocol stacks for the SRB is shown in Fig.
4.7.2-3.</p>

<h3 id="user-plane-aspects">4.7.3 User-plane Aspects</h3>
<h4 id="backhaul-transport">4.7.3.1 Backhaul transport</h4>
<p>The IAB-DU's IP traffic is routed over the wireless backhaul via the
BAP sublayer. The BAP sublayer is specified in TS 38.340 [31]. In
downstream direction, upper layer packets are encapsulated by the BAP
sublayer at the IAB-donor-DU and de-encapsulated at the destination
IAB-node. In upstream direction, upper layer packets are encapsulated at
the IAB-node and de-encapsulated at the IAB-donor-DU. IAB-specific
transport between IAB-donor-CU and IAB-donor-DU is specified in TS
38.401 [4].</p>
<p>On the BAP sublayer, packets are routed based on the BAP routing ID,
which is carried in the BAP header. The BAP header is added to the
packet when it arrives from upper layers, and the BAP header is stripped
off when the packet has reached its destination node. The selection of
the packet's BAP routing ID is configured by the IAB-donor-CU. The BAP
routing ID consists of BAP address and BAP path ID, where the BAP
address indicates the destination node of the packet on the BAP
sublayer, and the BAP path ID indicates the routing path the packet
should follow to this destination. For the purpose of routing, each
IAB-node and IAB-donor-DU is further configured with a designated BAP
address.</p>
<p>On each hop of the packet's path, the IAB-node inspects the packet's
BAP address in the BAP routing ID carried in the BAP header to determine
if the packet has reached its destination, i.e., matches the IAB-node's
BAP address. In case the packet has <em>not</em> reached the
destination, the IAB-node determines the next hop backhaul link,
referred to as <em>egress</em> link, based on the BAP routing ID carried
in the BAP header and a routing configuration it received from the
IAB-donor-CU.</p>
<p>For each packet, the IAB-node further determines the egress BH RLC
channel on the designated egress link. For packets arriving from upper
layers, the designated egress BH RLC channel is configured by the
IAB-donor-CU, and it is based on upper layer traffic specifiers. Since
each BH RLC channel is configured with QoS information or priority
level, BH-RLC-channel selection facilitates traffic-specific
prioritization and QoS enforcement on the BH. For F1-U traffic, it is
possible to map each GTP-U tunnel to a dedicated BH RLC channel or to
aggregate multiple GTP-U tunnels into one common BH RLC channel. For
traffic other than F1-U traffic, it is possible to map UE-associated
F1AP messages, non-UE-associated F1AP messages and non-F1 traffic onto
the same or separate BH RLC channels.</p>
<p>When packets are routed from one BH link to another, the egress BH
RLC channel on the egress BH link is determined based on the mapping
configuration between ingress BH RLC channels and egress BH RLC channels
provided by the IAB-donor-CU.</p>
<h4 id="flow-and-congestion-control">4.7.3.2 Flow and Congestion
Control</h4>
<p>Flow and congestion control can be supported in both upstream and
downstream directions in order to avoid congestion-related packet drops
on IAB-nodes and IAB-donor-DU:</p>
<p>- In upstream direction, UL scheduling on MAC layer can support flow
control on each hop;</p>
<p>- In downstream direction, the NR user plane protocol (TS 38.425
[33]) supports flow and congestion control between the IAB-node and the
IAB-donor-CU for UE bearers that terminate at this IAB-node. Further,
flow control is supported on BAP sublayer, where the IAB-node can send
feedback information on the available buffer size for an ingress BH RLC
channel or BAP routing ID to its parent node. The feedback can be sent
proactively, e.g., when the buffer load exceeds a certain threshold, or
based on polling by the parent node.</p>
<h4 id="uplink-scheduling-latency">4.7.3.3 Uplink Scheduling
Latency</h4>
<p>The IAB-node can reduce UL scheduling latency through signalling of a
Pre-emptive BSR to its parent node. The IAB-node can send the
Pre-emptive BSR based on UL grants it has provided to child nodes and/or
UEs, or based on BSRs it has received from child nodes or UEs (Figure
4.7.3.3-1). The Pre-emptive BSR conveys the data expected rather than
the data buffered.</p>

<p>The IAB-node integration procedure is captured in TS 38.401 [4].</p>
<h4 id="iab-node-migration">4.7.4.2 IAB-node Migration</h4>
<p>The IAB-node can migrate to a different parent node underneath the
same IAB-donor-CU. The IAB-node continues providing access and backhaul
service when migrating to a different parent node.</p>
<p>The IAB-MT can also migrate to a different parent node underneath
another IAB-donor-CU. In this case, the collocated IAB-DU and the
IAB-DU(s) of its descendant node(s) retain F1 connectivity with the
initial IAB-donor-CU. The IAB-MT of each descendant node and all the
served UEs retain the RRC connectivity with the initial IAB-donor-CU.
This migration is referred to as <em>inter-donor partial migration</em>.
The IAB-node, whose IAB-MT migrates to the new IAB-donor-CU, is referred
to as a <em>boundary IAB-node</em>. After inter-donor partial migration,
the F1 traffic of the IAB-DU and its descendant nodes is routed via the
BAP layer of the IAB topology to which the IAB-MT has migrated.</p>
<p>Inter-donor partial migration is only supported for SA-mode.</p>
<p>The intra-donor IAB-node migration procedure and inter-donor partial
migration procedures are captured in TS 38.401 [4].</p>
<h4 id="topological-redundancy">4.7.4.3 Topological Redundancy</h4>
<p>The IAB-node may have redundant routes to the IAB-donor-CU(s).</p>
<p>For IAB-nodes operating in SA-mode, NR DC can be used to enable route
redundancy in the BH by allowing the IAB-MT to have concurrent BH links
with two parent nodes. The parent nodes may be connected to the same or
to different IAB-donor-CUs, which control the establishment and release
of redundant routes via these two parent nodes. Either parent node's
gNB-DU functionality together with the respective IAB-donor-CU assumes
the role of the IAB-MT's master node or secondary node. The NR DC
framework (e.g., MCG/SCG-related procedures) is used to configure the
dual radio links with the parent nodes (TS 37.340 [21]).</p>
<p>The procedure for establishment of topological redundancy for
IAB-nodes operating in SA-mode is captured in TS 38.401 [4].</p>
<p>An IAB-node operating in NR-DC may also use one of its links for BH
connectivity with an IAB-donor and the other link for access-only
connectivity with a separate gNB that does not assume IAB-donor role.
The IAB-donor can assume the MN or the SN role. The IAB-node may
exchange F1-C traffic with the IAB-donor via the backhaul link and/or
via the access link with the gNB. In the latter case, the F1-C messages
are carried over NR RRC between the IAB-node and the gNB, and via XnAP
between the gNB and the IAB-donor.</p>
<p>IAB-nodes operating in EN-DC can exchange F1-C traffic with the
IAB-donor via the MeNB. The F1-C message is carried over LTE RRC using
SRB2 between IAB-node and MeNB and via X2AP between the MeNB and the
IAB-donor.</p>
<p>The procedures for establishment of redundant transport of F1-C for
IAB-nodes using NR-DC and EN-DC are captured in TS 37.340 [21] and TS
38.401 [4].</p>
<h4 id="backhaul-rlf-recovery">4.7.4.4 Backhaul RLF Recovery</h4>
<p>When the IAB-node using SA-mode declares RLF on the backhaul link, it
can perform RLF recovery at another parent node underneath the same or
underneath a different IAB-donor-CU. In the latter case, the collocated
IAB-DU and the IAB-DU(s) of its descendant node(s) may retain the F1
connectivity with the initial IAB-donor-CU, while the IAB-MT(s) of the
descendant node(s) and all the served UEs retain the RRC connectivity
with the initial IAB-donor-CU, in the same manner as for <em>inter-donor
partial migration</em>.</p>
<p>The BH RLF recovery procedure for the IAB-node is captured in TS
38.401 [4]. BH RLF declaration for IAB-node and the aspects of RLF
recovery by the IAB-MT are handled in clause 9.2.7 of the present
document.</p>
<h4 id="ota-timing-synchronization">4.7.4.5 OTA timing
synchronization</h4>
<p>An IAB-DU is subject to the same downlink timing alignment of a gNB.
The IAB-DU may use the received downlink signal from a parent as a
reference to control its downlink timing using TA in conjunction with an
additional Tdelta parameter received by the collocated IAB-MT from the
parent via MAC-CE.</p>
<h4 id="inter-node-discovery">4.7.4.6 Inter node discovery</h4>
<p>Inter node discovery is supported via SSB-based and/or CSI-RS-based
measurements. An IAB-node can be configured to transmit and receive off
synchronization raster SSB signals to discover neighbouring IAB-nodes.
The configuration is not expected to create a conflict between IAB-DU
SSB transmission and IAB-MT SSB measurement windows.</p>
<h2 id="non-public-networks">4.8 Non-Public Networks</h2>

Physical-layer processing for physical downlink shared channel</h3>
<p>The downlink physical-layer processing of transport channels consists
of the following steps:</p>
<p>- Transport block CRC attachment;</p>
<p>- Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment;</p>
<p>- Channel coding: LDPC coding;</p>
<p>- Physical-layer hybrid-ARQ processing;</p>
<p>- Rate matching;</p>
<p>- Scrambling;</p>
<p>- Modulation: QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM, and 1024QAM;</p>
<p>- Layer mapping;</p>
<p>- Mapping to assigned resources and antenna ports.</p>
<p>The UE may assume that at least one symbol with demodulation
reference signal is present on each layer in which PDSCH is transmitted
to a UE, and up to 3 additional DMRS can be configured by higher
layers.</p>
<p>Phase Tracking RS may be transmitted on additional symbols to aid
receiver phase tracking.</p>
<p>The DL-SCH physical layer model is described in TS 38.202 [20].</p>
<h3 id="physical-downlink-control-channels">5.2.3 Physical downlink
control channels</h3>
<p>The Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) can be used to schedule
DL transmissions on PDSCH and UL transmissions on PUSCH, where the
Downlink Control Information (DCI) on PDCCH includes:</p>
<p>- Downlink assignments containing at least modulation and coding
format, resource allocation, and hybrid-ARQ information related to
DL-SCH;</p>
<p>- Uplink scheduling grants containing at least modulation and coding
format, resource allocation, and hybrid-ARQ information related to
UL-SCH.</p>
<p>In addition to scheduling, PDCCH can be used to for:</p>
<p>- Activation and deactivation of configured PUSCH transmission with
configured grant;</p>
<p>- Activation and deactivation of PDSCH semi-persistent
transmission;</p>
<p>- Notifying one or more UEs of the slot format;</p>
<p>- Notifying one or more UEs of the PRB(s) and OFDM symbol(s) where
the UE may assume no transmission is intended for the UE;</p>
<p>- Transmission of TPC commands for PUCCH and PUSCH;</p>
<p>- Transmission of one or more TPC commands for SRS transmissions by
one or more UEs;</p>
<p>- Switching a UE's active bandwidth part;</p>
<p>- Initiating a random access procedure;</p>
<p>- Indicating the UE(s) to monitor the PDCCH during the next
occurrence of the DRX on-duration;</p>
<p>- In IAB context, indicating the availability for soft symbols of an
IAB-DU;</p>
<p>- Triggering one shot HARQ-ACK codebook feedback;</p>
<p>- For operation with shared spectrum channel access:</p>
<p>- Triggering search space set group switching;</p>
<p>- Indicating one or more UEs about the available RB sets and channel
occupancy time duration;</p>
<p>- Indicating downlink feedback information for configured grant PUSCH
(CG-DFI).</p>
<p>A UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates in the configured monitoring
occasions in one or more configured COntrol REsource SETs (CORESETs)
according to the corresponding search space configurations.</p>
<p>A CORESET consists of a set of PRBs with a time duration of 1 to 3
OFDM symbols. The resource units Resource Element Groups (REGs) and
Control Channel Elements (CCEs) are defined within a CORESET with each
CCE consisting a set of REGs. Control channels are formed by aggregation
of CCE. Different code rates for the control channels are realized by
aggregating different number of CCE. Interleaved and non-interleaved
CCE-to-REG mapping are supported in a CORESET.</p>
<p>The PDCCH repetition is operated by using two search spaces which are
explicitly linked by configuration provided by the RRC layer, and are
associated with corresponding CORESETs. For PDCCH repetition, two linked
search spaces are configured with the same number of candidates, and two
PDCCH candidates in two search spaces are linked with the same candidate
index. When PDCCH repetition is scheduled to a UE, an intra-slot
repetition is allowed and each repetition has the same number of CCEs
and coded bits, and corresponds to the same DCI payload.</p>
<p>Polar coding is used for PDCCH.</p>
<p>Each resource element group carrying PDCCH carries its own DMRS.</p>
<p>QPSK modulation is used for PDCCH.</p>
<h3 id="synchronization-signal-and-pbch-block">5.2.4 Synchronization
signal and PBCH block</h3>
<p>The Synchronization Signal and PBCH block (SSB) consists of primary
and secondary synchronization signals (PSS, SSS), each occupying 1
symbol and 127 subcarriers, and PBCH spanning across 3 OFDM symbols and
240 subcarriers, but on one symbol leaving an unused part in the middle
for SSS as show in Figure 5.2.4-1. The possible time locations of SSBs
within a half-frame are determined by sub-carrier spacing and the
periodicity of the half-frames where SSBs are transmitted is configured
by the network. During a half-frame, different SSBs may be transmitted
in different spatial directions (i.e. using different beams, spanning
the coverage area of a cell).</p>
<p>Within the frequency span of a carrier, multiple SSBs can be
transmitted. The PCIs of SSBs transmitted in different frequency
locations do not have to be unique, i.e. different SSBs in the frequency
domain can have different PCIs. However, when an SSB is associated with
an RMSI, the SSB is referred to as a Cell-Defining SSB (CD-SSB). A PCell
is always associated to a CD-SSB located on the synchronization
raster.</p>
<p><img src="media/image21.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 5.2.4-1: Time-frequency structure of SSB</p>
<p>Polar coding is used for PBCH.</p>
<p>The UE may assume a band-specific sub-carrier spacing for the SSB
unless a network has configured the UE to assume a different sub-carrier
spacing.</p>
<p>PBCH symbols carry its own frequency-multiplexed DMRS.</p>
<p>QPSK modulation is used for PBCH.</p>
<p>The PBCH physical layer model is described in TS 38.202 [20].</p>
<h3 id="physical-layer-procedures">5.2.5 Physical layer procedures</h3>
<h4 id="link-adaptation">5.2.5.1 Link adaptation</h4>
<p>Link adaptation (AMC: adaptive modulation and coding) with various
modulation schemes and channel coding rates is applied to the PDSCH. The
same coding and modulation is applied to all groups of resource blocks
belonging to the same L2 PDU scheduled to one user within one
transmission duration and within a MIMO codeword.</p>
<p>For channel state estimation purposes, the UE may be configured to
measure CSI-RS and estimate the downlink channel state based on the
CSI-RS measurements. The UE feeds the estimated channel state back to
the gNB to be used in link adaptation.</p>
<h4 id="power-control">5.2.5.2 Power Control</h4>
<p>Downlink power control can be used.</p>
<h4 id="cell-search">5.2.5.3 Cell search</h4>
<p>Cell search is the procedure by which a UE acquires time and
frequency synchronization with a cell and detects the Cell ID of that
cell. NR cell search is based on the primary and secondary
synchronization signals, and PBCH DMRS, located on the synchronization
raster.</p>
<h4 id="harq">5.2.5.4 HARQ</h4>
<p>Asynchronous Incremental Redundancy Hybrid ARQ is supported. The gNB
provides the UE with the HARQ-ACK feedback timing either dynamically in
the DCI or semi-statically in an RRC configuration. Retransmission of
HARQ-ACK feedback is supported by using enhanced dynamic codebook and/or
one-shot triggering of HARQ-ACK transmission for (i) all configured CCs
and HARQ processes in the PUCCH group, (ii) a configured subset of CCs
and/or HARQ processes in the PUCCH group, or (iii) a dynamically
indicated HARQ-ACK feedback instance. For HARQ-ACK of SPS PDSCH without
associated PDCCH, in case of HARQ-ACK dropping due to TDD specific
collisions, the HARQ-ACK feedback can be deferred to a next available
PUCCH transmission occasion.</p>
<p>The UE may be configured to receive code block group based
transmissions where retransmissions may be scheduled to carry a sub-set
of all the code blocks of a TB.</p>
<h4 id="reception-of-sib1">5.2.5.5 Reception of SIB1</h4>
<p>The Master Information Block (MIB) on PBCH provides the UE with
parameters (e.g. CORESET#0 configuration) for monitoring of PDCCH for
scheduling PDSCH that carries the System Information Block 1 (SIB1).
PBCH may also indicate that there is no associated SIB1, in which case
the UE may be pointed to another frequency from where to search for an
SSB that is associated with a SIB1 as well as a frequency range where
the UE may assume no SSB associated with SIB1 is present. The indicated
frequency range is confined within a contiguous spectrum allocation of
the same operator in which SSB is detected.</p>
<h3
id="downlink-reference-signals-and-measurements-for-positioning">5.2.6
Downlink Reference Signals and Measurements for Positioning</h3>
<p>The DL Positioning Reference Signals (DL PRS) are defined to
facilitate support of different positioning methods such as DL-TDOA,
DL-AoD, multi-RTT through the following set of UE measurements DL RSTD,
DL PRS-RSRP, and UE Rx-Tx time difference respectively as described in
TS 38.305 [42].</p>
<p>Besides DL PRS signals, UE can use SSB and CSI-RS for RRM (RSRP and
RSRQ) measurements for E-CID type of positioning.</p>
<h2 id="uplink">5.3 Uplink</h2>
<h3 id="uplink-transmission-scheme">5.3.1 Uplink transmission
scheme</h3>
<p>Two transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based
transmission and non-codebook based transmission.</p>
<p>For codebook based transmission, the gNB provides the UE with a
transmit precoding matrix indication in the DCI. The UE uses the
indication to select the PUSCH transmit precoder from the codebook. For
non-codebook based transmission, the UE determines its PUSCH precoder
based on wideband SRI field from the DCI.</p>
<p>A closed loop DMRS based spatial multiplexing is supported for PUSCH.
For a given UE, up to 4 layer transmissions are supported. The number of
code words is one. When transform precoding is used, only a single MIMO
layer transmission is supported.</p>
<p>Transmission durations from 1 to 14 symbols in a slot is
supported.</p>
<p>Aggregation of multiple slots with TB repetition is supported.</p>
<p>Two types of frequency hopping are supported, intra-slot frequency
hopping, and in case of slot aggregation, inter-slot frequency hopping.
Intra-slot and inter-slot frequency hopping are not supported when PRB
interlace uplink transmission waveform is used.</p>
<p>PUSCH may be scheduled with DCI on PDCCH, or a semi-static configured
grant may be provided over RRC, where two types of operation are
supported:</p>
<p>- The first PUSCH is triggered with a DCI, with subsequent PUSCH
transmissions following the RRC configuration and scheduling received on
the DCI, or</p>
<p>- The PUSCH is triggered by data arrival to the UE's transmit buffer
and the PUSCH transmissions follow the RRC configuration.</p>
<h3

Physical-layer processing for physical uplink shared channel</h3>
<p>The uplink physical-layer processing of transport channels consists
of the following steps:</p>
<p>- Transport Block CRC attachment;</p>
<p>- Code block segmentation and Code Block CRC attachment;</p>
<p>- Channel coding: LDPC coding;</p>
<p>- Physical-layer hybrid-ARQ processing;</p>
<p>- Rate matching;</p>
<p>- Scrambling;</p>
<p>- Modulation: π/2 BPSK (with transform precoding only), QPSK, 16QAM,
64QAM and 256QAM;</p>
<p>- Layer mapping, transform precoding (enabled/disabled by
configuration), and pre-coding;</p>
<p>- Mapping to assigned resources and antenna ports.</p>
<p>The UE transmits at least one symbol with demodulation reference
signal on each layer on each frequency hop in which the PUSCH is
transmitted, and up to 3 additional DMRS can be configured by higher
layers.</p>
<p>Phase Tracking RS may be transmitted on additional symbols to aid
receiver phase tracking.</p>
<p>The UL-SCH physical layer model is described in TS 38.202 [20].</p>
<p>For configured grants operation with shared spectrum channel access,
described in clause 10.3, a CG-UCI (Configured Grant Uplink Control
Information) can be transmitted in PUSCH scheduled by configured uplink
grant.</p>
<h3 id="physical-uplink-control-channel">5.3.3 Physical uplink control
channel</h3>
<p>Physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) carries the Uplink Control
Information (UCI) from the UE to the gNB. Five formats of PUCCH exist,
depending on the duration of PUCCH and the UCI payload size:</p>
<p>- Format #0: Short PUCCH of 1 or 2 symbols with small UCI payloads of
up to two bits with UE multiplexing capacity of up to 6 UEs with 1-bit
payload in the same PRB;</p>
<p>- Format #1: Long PUCCH of 4-14 symbols with small UCI payloads of up
to two bits with UE multiplexing capacity of up to 84 UEs without
frequency hopping and 36 UEs with frequency hopping in the same PRB;</p>
<p>- Format #2: Short PUCCH of 1 or 2 symbols with large UCI payloads of
more than two bits with no UE multiplexing capability in the same
PRBs;</p>
<p>- Format #3: Long PUCCH of 4-14 symbols with large UCI payloads with
no UE multiplexing capability in the same PRBs;</p>
<p>- Format #4: Long PUCCH of 4-14 symbols with moderate UCI payloads
with multiplexing capacity of up to 4 UEs in the same PRBs.</p>
<p>The short PUCCH format of up to two UCI bits is based on sequence
selection, while the short PUCCH format of more than two UCI bits
frequency multiplexes UCI and DMRS. The long PUCCH formats
time-multiplex the UCI and DMRS. Frequency hopping is supported for long
PUCCH formats and for short PUCCH formats of duration of 2 symbols.
Short and long PUCCH formats can be repeated over multiple slots or
sub-slots, where the repetition factor is either indicated dynamically
in the DCI or semi-statically in an RRC configuration.</p>
<p>For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, PUCCH
Format #0, #1, #2, #3 are extended to use resource in one PRB interlace
(up to two interlaces for Format #2 and Format #3) in one RB Set. PUCCH
Format #2 and #3 are enhanced to support multiplexing capacity of up to
4 UEs in the same PRB interlace when one interlace is used.</p>
<p>For operation in FR2-2, PUCCH Format #0, #1, #4 are extended to use
resource in configurable number of continuous PRBs, up to 16 PRBs.</p>
<p>Up to two PUCCH configurations can be configured for a UE per PUCCH
group (see TS 38.331 [12]), where the first PUCCH configuration is
associated with a PUCCH of priority index 0 (low) and the second PUCCH
configuration is associated with a PUCCH of priority index 1 (high).</p>
<p>UCI multiplexing in PUCCH is supported when PUCCH transmissions of
UCIs coincide in time, and are associated with the same priority
(high/low). In addition, multiplexing of HARQ-ACK of priority index 0
(low) and UCI of priority index 1 (high) in PUCCH of priority index 1
(high) is supported when PUCCH transmissions of HARQ-ACK of priority
index 0 and UCI of priority index 1 (high) coincide in time.</p>
<p>UCI multiplexing in PUSCH is supported when UCI and PUSCH
transmissions coincide in time, either due to transmission of a UL-SCH
transport block or due to triggering of A-CSI transmission without
UL-SCH transport block, and are associated with the same priority
(high/low). In addition, HARQ-ACK multiplexing of a certain priority in
PUSCH of a different priority is supported when HARQ-ACK and PUSCH
transmissions coincide in time, either due to transmission of a UL-SCH
transport block or due to triggering of A-CSI transmission without
UL-SCH transport block:</p>
<p>- UCI carrying HARQ-ACK feedback with 1 or 2 bits is multiplexed by
puncturing PUSCH;</p>
<p>- In all other cases UCI is multiplexed by rate matching PUSCH.</p>
<p>UCI consists of the following information:</p>
<p>- CSI;</p>
<p>- ACK/NAK;</p>
<p>- Scheduling request.</p>
<p>Simultaneous transmission of PUCCH and PUSCH associated with
different priorities on cells of different bands in a PUCCH group is
supported, where UCI multiplexing in the PUCCH associated with a
priority in combination of UCI multiplexing in a PUSCH associated with a
different priority is supported if the UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is of
same priority as the PUSCH.</p>
<p>Simultaneous transmission of PUCCH and PUSCH associated with same
priority on cells of different bands in a PUCCH group is supported (see
clause 9 of TS 38.213 [38]).</p>
<p>For operation with shared spectrum channel access, multiplexing of
CG-UCI and PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK feedback can be configured by the
gNB. If not configured, when PUCCH overlaps with PUSCH scheduled by a
configured grant within a PUCCH group and PUCCH carries HARQ ACK
feedback, PUSCH scheduled by configured grant is skipped.</p>
<p>QPSK and π/2 BPSK modulation can be used for long PUCCH with more
than 2 bits of information, QPSK is used for short PUCCH with more than
2 bits of information and BPSK and QPSK modulation can be used for long
PUCCH with up to 2 information bits.</p>
<p>Transform precoding is applied to PUCCH Format #3 and Format #4.</p>

<h3 id="random-access">5.3.4 Random access</h3>
<p>Random access preamble sequences, of four different lengths are
supported. Sequence length 839 is applied with subcarrier spacings of
1.25 and 5 kHz, sequence length 139 is applied with subcarrier spacings
of 15, 30, 60, 120, 480, and 960 kHz, sequence length of 571 is applied
with subcarrier spacings of 30, 120, and 480 kHz, and sequence length
1151 is applied with subcarrier spacings of 15 and 120 kHz. Sequence
length 839 supports unrestricted sets and restricted sets of Type A and
Type B, while sequence lengths 139, 571, and 1151 support unrestricted
sets only. Sequence length 839 is only used for operation with licensed
channel access while sequence length 139 can be used for operation with
either licensed or shared spectrum channel access. For FR1, sequence
lengths of 571 and 1151 can be used only for operation with shared
spectrum channel access. For FR2-2, sequence lengths of 571 can be used
for operation with either licensed or shared spectrum channel access
only with subcarrier spacings of 120 kHz and 480 kHz and sequence
lengths of 1151 can be used for operation with either licensed or shared
spectrum channel access only with subcarrier spacings of 120 kHz.</p>
<p>Multiple PRACH preamble formats are defined with one or more PRACH
OFDM symbols, and different CP and guard time. The PRACH preamble
configuration to use is provided to the UE in the system
information.</p>
<p>For IAB additional random access configurations are defined. These
configurations are obtained by extending the random access
configurations defined for UEs via scaling the periodicity and/or
offsetting the time domain position of the RACH occasions.</p>
<p>IAB-MTs can be provided with random access configurations (as defined
for UEs or after applying the aforementioned scaling/offsetting)
different from random access configurations provided to UEs.</p>
<p>The UE calculates the PRACH transmit power for the retransmission of
the preamble based on the most recent estimate pathloss and power
ramping counter.</p>
<p>The system information provides information for the UE to determine
the association between the SSB and the RACH resources. The RSRP
threshold for SSB selection for RACH resource association is
configurable by network.</p>

<h4 id="link-adaptation-1">5.3.5.1 Link adaptation</h4>
<p>Four types of link adaptation are supported as follows:</p>
<p>- Adaptive transmission bandwidth;</p>
<p>- Adaptive transmission duration;</p>
<p>- Transmission power control;</p>
<p>- Adaptive modulation and channel coding rate.</p>
<p>For channel state estimation purposes, the UE may be configured to
transmit SRS that the gNB may use to estimate the uplink channel state
and use the estimate in link adaptation.</p>
<h4 id="uplink-power-control">5.3.5.2 Uplink Power control</h4>
<p>The gNB determines the desired uplink transmit power and provides
uplink transmit power control commands to the UE. The UE uses the
provided uplink transmit power control commands to adjust its transmit
power.</p>
<h4 id="uplink-timing-control">5.3.5.3 Uplink timing control</h4>
<p>The gNB (including IAB-DU and IAB-donor-DU) determines the desired
Timing Advance setting and provides that to the UE (or IAB-MT). The
UE/IAB-MT uses the provided TA to determine its uplink transmit timing
relative to the UE's/IAB-MTs observed downlink receive timing.</p>
<p>An IAB-node may support additional modes for uplink timing:</p>
<p>- The IAB-MT uses the provided TA plus a provided additional offset
to determine its uplink transmission timing, to facilitate parent node's
IAB-MT Rx / IAB-DU Rx multiplexing;</p>
<p>- The IAB-MT aligns its uplink transmission timing to that of the
collocated IAB-DU downlink transmission timing, to facilitate IAB-MT Tx
/ IAB-DU Tx multiplexing of this IAB-node.</p>
<p>The IAB-node uplink timing mode is indicated by the parent node via
MAC-CE.</p>
<h4 id="harq-1">5.3.5.4 HARQ</h4>
<p>Asynchronous Incremental Redundancy Hybrid ARQ is supported. The gNB
schedules each uplink transmission and retransmission using the uplink
grant on DCI. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, UE can
also retransmit on configured grants if configured.</p>
<p>The UE may be configured to transmit code block group based
transmissions where retransmissions may be scheduled to carry a sub-set
of all the code blocks of a transport block.</p>
<p>Up to two HARQ-ACK codebooks corresponding to a priority (high/low)
can be constructed simultaneously. For each HARQ-ACK codebook, more than
one PUCCH for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot is supported. Each
PUCCH is limited within one sub-slot, and the sub-slot pattern is
configured per HARQ-ACK codebook.</p>
<h4 id="prioritization-of-overlapping-transmissions">5.3.5.5

<h2 id="carrier-aggregation">5.4 Carrier aggregation</h2>
<h3 id="carrier-aggregation-1">5.4.1 Carrier aggregation</h3>
<p>In Carrier Aggregation (CA), two or more Component Carriers (CCs) are
aggregated. A UE may simultaneously receive or transmit on one or
multiple CCs depending on its capabilities:</p>
<p>- A UE with single timing advance capability for CA can
simultaneously receive and/or transmit on multiple CCs corresponding to
multiple serving cells sharing the same timing advance (multiple serving
cells grouped in one TAG);</p>
<p>- A UE with multiple timing advance capability for CA can
simultaneously receive and/or transmit on multiple CCs corresponding to
multiple serving cells with different timing advances (multiple serving
cells grouped in multiple TAGs). NG-RAN ensures that each TAG contains
at least one serving cell;</p>
<p>- A non-CA capable UE can receive on a single CC and transmit on a
single CC corresponding to one serving cell only (one serving cell in
one TAG).</p>
<p>CA is supported for both contiguous and non-contiguous CCs. When CA
is deployed frame timing and SFN are aligned across cells that can be
aggregated, or an offset in multiples of slots between the PCell/PSCell
and an SCell is configured to the UE. The maximum number of configured
CCs for a UE is 16 for DL and 16 for UL.</p>
<h3 id="supplementary-uplink">5.4.2 Supplementary Uplink</h3>
<p>In conjunction with a UL/DL carrier pair (FDD band) or a
bidirectional carrier (TDD band), a UE may be configured with
additional, Supplementary Uplink (SUL). SUL differs from the aggregated
uplink in that the UE may be scheduled to transmit either on the
supplementary uplink or on the uplink of the carrier being supplemented,
but not on both at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="uplink-tx-switching">5.4.3 Uplink Tx switching</h3>

carrier for enabling 2Tx UL transmission on that carrier.</p>
<h2 id="transport-channels">5.5 Transport Channels</h2>
<p>The physical layer offers information transfer services to MAC and
higher layers. The physical layer transport services are described by
<em>how</em> and with what characteristics data are transferred over the
radio interface. An adequate term for this is "Transport Channel". This
should be clearly separated from the classification of <em>what</em> is
transported, which relates to the concept of logical channels at MAC
sublayer.</p>
<p>Downlink transport channel types are:</p>
<p>1. <strong>Broadcast Channel (BCH)</strong> characterised by:</p>
<p>- fixed, pre-defined transport format;</p>

<h2 id="access-to-shared-spectrum">5.6 Access to Shared Spectrum</h2>
<h3 id="overview">5.6.1 Overview</h3>
<p>NR Radio Access operating with shared spectrum channel access can
operate in different modes where either PCell, PSCell, or SCells can be
in shared spectrum and an SCell may or may not be configured with
uplink. The applicable deployment scenarios are described in Annex
B.3.</p>
<p>The gNB performs channel access mode procedures as described in TS
37.213 [37]. The gNB and the UE may apply Listen-Before-Talk (LBT)
before performing a transmission on a cell configured with shared
spectrum channel access. When LBT is applied, the transmitter listens
to/senses the channel to determine whether the channel is free or busy
and performs transmission only if the channel is sensed free.</p>
<p>When the UE detects consistent uplink LBT failures, it takes actions
as specified in TS 38.321 [6]. The detection is per Bandwidth Part (BWP)
and based on all uplink transmissions within this BWP. When consistent
uplink LBT failures are detected on SCell(s), the UE reports this to the
corresponding gNB (MN for MCG, SN for SCG) via MAC CE on a different
serving cell than the SCell(s) where the failures were detected. If no
resources are available to transmit the MAC CE, a Scheduling Request
(SR) can be transmitted by the UE. When consistent uplink LBT failures
are detected on SpCell, the UE switches to another UL BWP with
configured RACH resources on that cell, initiates RACH, and reports the
failure via MAC CE. When multiple UL BWPs are available for switching,
it is up to the UE implementation which one to select. For PSCell, if
consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on all the UL BWPs with
configured RACH resources, the UE declares SCG RLF and reports the
failure to the MN via <em>SCGFailureInformation.</em> For PCell, if the
uplink LBT failures are detected on all the UL BWP(s) with configured
RACH resources, the UE declares RLF.</p>
<h3 id="channel-access-priority-classes">5.6.2 Channel Access Priority
Classes</h3>
<p>The Channel Access Priority Classes (CAPC) of radio bearers and MAC
CEs are either fixed or configurable for operation in FR1:</p>
<p>- Fixed to the lowest priority for the padding BSR and recommended
bit rate MAC CEs;</p>
<p>- Fixed to the highest priority for SRB0, SRB1, SRB3 and other MAC
CEs;</p>
<p>- Configured by the gNB for SRB2 and DRB.</p>
<p>When choosing the CAPC of a DRB, the gNB takes into account the 5QIs
of all the QoS flows multiplexed in that DRB while considering fairness
between different traffic types and transmissions. Table 5.6.2-1 below
shows which CAPC should be used for which standardized 5QIs i.e. which
CAPC to use for a given QoS flow.</p>
<p>NOTE: A QoS flow corresponding to a non-standardized 5QI (i.e.
operator specific 5QI) should use the CAPC of the standardized 5QI which
best matches the QoS characteristics of the non-standardized 5QI.</p>

<h2 id="sidelink">5.7 Sidelink</h2>
<h3 id="general">5.7.1 General</h3>
<p>Sidelink supports UE-to-UE direct communication using the sidelink
resource allocation modes, physical-layer signals/channels, and physical
layer procedures below.</p>
<h3 id="sidelink-resource-allocation-modes">5.7.2 Sidelink resource
allocation modes</h3>
<p>Two sidelink resource allocation modes are supported: mode 1 and mode
2. In mode 1, the sidelink resource allocation is provided by the
network. In mode 2, UE decides the SL transmission resources in the
resource pool(s).</p>
<h3 id="physical-sidelink-channels-and-signals">5.7.3 Physical sidelink
channels and signals</h3>
<p>Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH) indicates resource and
other transmission parameters used by a UE for PSSCH. PSCCH transmission
is associated with a DM-RS.</p>
<p>Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH) transmits the TBs of data
themselves, and control information for HARQ procedures and CSI feedback
triggers, etc. At least 6 OFDM symbols within a slot are used for PSSCH
transmission. PSSCH transmission is associated with a DM-RS and may be
associated with a PT-RS.</p>
<p>Physical Sidelink Feedback Channel (PSFCH) carries HARQ feedback over
the sidelink from a UE which is an intended recipient of a PSSCH
transmission to the UE which performed the transmission. PSFCH sequence
is transmitted in one PRB repeated over two OFDM symbols near the end of
the sidelink resource in a slot.</p>
<p>The Sidelink synchronization signal consists of sidelink primary and
sidelink secondary synchronization signals (S-PSS, S-SSS), each
occupying 2 symbols and 127 subcarriers. Physical Sidelink Broadcast
Channel (PSBCH) occupies 9 and 7 symbols for normal and extended CP
cases respectively, including the associated DM-RS.</p>
<h3 id="physical-layer-procedures-for-sidelink">5.7.4 Physical layer

<h4 id="harq-feedback">5.7.4.1 HARQ feedback</h4>
<p>Sidelink HARQ feedback uses PSFCH and can be operated in one of two
options. In one option, which can be configured for unicast and
groupcast, PSFCH transmits either ACK or NACK using a resource dedicated
to a single PSFCH transmitting UE. In another option, which can be
configured for groupcast, PSFCH transmits NACK, or no PSFCH signal is
transmitted, on a resource that can be shared by multiple PSFCH
transmitting UEs.</p>
<p>In sidelink resource allocation mode 1, a UE which received PSFCH can
report sidelink HARQ feedback to gNB via PUCCH or PUSCH.</p>
<h4 id="power-control-1">5.7.4.2 Power Control</h4>
<p>For in-coverage operation, the power spectral density of the sidelink
transmissions can be adjusted based on the pathloss from the gNB.</p>
<p>For unicast, the power spectral density of some sidelink
transmissions can be adjusted based on the pathloss between the two
communicating UEs.</p>
<h4 id="csi-report">5.7.4.3 CSI report</h4>
<p>For unicast, channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS) is

<h2 id="overview-1">6.1 Overview</h2>
<p>The layer 2 of NR is split into the following sublayers: Medium
Access Control (MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), Packet Data Convergence
Protocol (PDCP) and Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP). The two
figures below depict the Layer 2 architecture for downlink and uplink,
where:</p>
<p>- The physical layer offers to the MAC sublayer transport
channels;</p>
<p>- The MAC sublayer offers to the RLC sublayer logical channels;</p>
<p>- The RLC sublayer offers to the PDCP sublayer RLC channels;</p>
<p>- The PDCP sublayer offers to the SDAP sublayer radio bearers;</p>
<p>- The SDAP sublayer offers to 5GC QoS flows;</p>
<p>- <em>Comp.</em> refers to header compression or uplink data
compression;</p>
<p>- <em>Segm.</em> refers to segmentation;</p>
<p>- Control channels (BCCH, PCCH are not depicted for clarity).</p>
<p>NOTE: The gNB may not be able to guarantee that a L2 buffer overflow
will never occur. If such overflow occurs, the UE may discard packets in
the L2 buffer.</p>

<p>Radio bearers are categorized into two groups: data radio bearers
(DRB) for user plane data and signalling radio bearers (SRB) for control
plane data.</p>
<p>For IAB, the Layer 2 of NR includes: MAC, RLC, Backhaul Adaptation
Protocol (BAP), PDCP and optionally SDAP. The BAP sublayer supports
routing across the IAB topology and traffic mapping to BH RLC channels
for enforcement of traffic prioritization and QoS.</p>

<h2 id="mac-sublayer">6.2 MAC Sublayer</h2>
<h3 id="services-and-functions">6.2.1 Services and Functions</h3>
<p>The main services and functions of the MAC sublayer include:</p>
<p>- Mapping between logical channels and transport channels;</p>
<p>- Multiplexing/demultiplexing of MAC SDUs belonging to one or
different logical channels into/from transport blocks (TB) delivered
to/from the physical layer on transport channels;</p>
<p>- Scheduling information reporting;</p>
<p>- Error correction through HARQ (one HARQ entity per cell in case of
CA);</p>
<p>- Priority handling between UEs by means of dynamic scheduling;</p>
<p>- Priority handling between logical channels of one UE by means of
logical channel prioritisation;</p>
<p>- Priority handling between overlapping resources of one UE;</p>
<p>- Padding.</p>
<p>A single MAC entity can support multiple numerologies, transmission
timings and cells. Mapping restrictions in logical channel
prioritisation control which numerology(ies), cell(s), and transmission
timing(s) a logical channel can use (see clause 16.1.2).</p>
<h3 id="logical-channels">6.2.2 Logical Channels</h3>
<p>Different kinds of data transfer services as offered by MAC. Each
logical channel type is defined by what type of information is
transferred. Logical channels are classified into two groups: Control
Channels and Traffic Channels. Control channels are used for the
transfer of control plane information only:</p>
<p>- Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH): a downlink channel for
broadcasting system control information.</p>
<p>- Paging Control Channel (PCCH): a downlink channel that carries
paging messages.</p>
<p>- Common Control Channel (CCCH): channel for transmitting control
information between UEs and network. This channel is used for UEs having
no RRC connection with the network.</p>
<p>- Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH): a point-to-point bi-directional
channel that transmits dedicated control information between a UE and
the network. Used by UEs having an RRC connection.</p>
<p>Traffic channels are used for the transfer of user plane information
only:</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH): point-to-point
channel, dedicated to one UE, for the transfer of user information. A
DTCH can exist in both uplink and downlink.</p>
<h3 id="mapping-to-transport-channels">6.2.3 Mapping to Transport
Channels</h3>
<p>In Downlink, the following connections between logical channels and
transport channels exist:</p>
<p>- BCCH can be mapped to BCH;</p>
<p>- BCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;</p>
<p>- PCCH can be mapped to PCH;</p>
<p>- CCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;</p>
<p>- DCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;</p>
<p>- DTCH can be mapped to DL-SCH.</p>
<p>In Uplink, the following connections between logical channels and
transport channels exist:</p>
<p>- CCCH can be mapped to UL-SCH;</p>
<p>- DCCH can be mapped to UL- SCH;</p>
<p>- DTCH can be mapped to UL-SCH.</p>
<h3 id="harq-2">6.2.4 HARQ</h3>
<p>The HARQ functionality ensures delivery between peer entities at
Layer 1. A single HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer
is not configured for downlink/uplink spatial multiplexing, and when the
physical layer is configured for downlink/uplink spatial multiplexing, a
single HARQ process supports one or multiple TBs.</p>
<h2 id="rlc-sublayer">6.3 RLC Sublayer</h2>
<h3 id="transmission-modes">6.3.1 Transmission Modes</h3>
<p>The RLC sublayer supports three transmission modes:</p>
<p>- Transparent Mode (TM);</p>
<p>- Unacknowledged Mode (UM);</p>
<p>- Acknowledged Mode (AM).</p>
<p>The RLC configuration is per logical channel with no dependency on
numerologies and/or transmission durations, and ARQ can operate on any
of the numerologies and/or transmission durations the logical channel is
configured with.</p>
<p>For SRB0, paging and broadcast system information, TM mode is used.
For other SRBs AM mode used. For DRBs, either UM or AM mode are
used.</p>
<h3 id="services-and-functions-1">6.3.2 Services and Functions</h3>
<p>The main services and functions of the RLC sublayer depend on the
transmission mode and include:</p>
<p>- Transfer of upper layer PDUs;</p>
<p>- Sequence numbering independent of the one in PDCP (UM and AM);</p>
<p>- Error Correction through ARQ (AM only);</p>
<p>- Segmentation (AM and UM) and re-segmentation (AM only) of RLC
SDUs;</p>
<p>- Reassembly of SDU (AM and UM);</p>
<p>- Duplicate Detection (AM only);</p>
<p>- RLC SDU discard (AM and UM);</p>
<p>- RLC re-establishment;</p>
<p>- Protocol error detection (AM only).</p>
<h3 id="arq">6.3.3 ARQ</h3>
<p>The ARQ within the RLC sublayer has the following
characteristics:</p>
<p>- ARQ retransmits RLC SDUs or RLC SDU segments based on RLC status
reports;</p>
<p>- Polling for RLC status report is used when needed by RLC;</p>
<p>- RLC receiver can also trigger RLC status report after detecting a
missing RLC SDU or RLC SDU segment.</p>
<h2 id="pdcp-sublayer">6.4 PDCP Sublayer</h2>
<h3 id="services-and-functions-2">6.4.1 Services and Functions</h3>
<p>The main services and functions of the PDCP sublayer include:</p>
<p>- Transfer of data (user plane or control plane);</p>
<p>- Maintenance of PDCP SNs;</p>
<p>- Header compression and decompression using the ROHC protocol;</p>
<p>- Header compression and decompression using EHC protocol;</p>
<p>- Compression and decompression of uplink PDCP SDUs: DEFLATE based

<p>- Duplication;</p>
<p>- Reordering and in-order delivery;</p>
<p>- Out-of-order delivery;</p>
<p>- Duplicate discarding.</p>
<p>Since PDCP does not allow COUNT to wrap around in DL and UL, it is up
to the network to prevent it from happening (e.g. by using a release and
add of the corresponding radio bearer or a full configuration).</p>
<h2 id="sdap-sublayer">6.5 SDAP Sublayer</h2>
<p>The main services and functions of SDAP include:</p>
<p>- Mapping between a QoS flow and a data radio bearer;</p>
<p>- Marking QoS flow ID (QFI) in both DL and UL packets.</p>
<p>A single protocol entity of SDAP is configured for each individual
PDU session.</p>
<h2 id="l2-data-flow">6.6 L2 Data Flow</h2>
<p>An example of the Layer 2 Data Flow is depicted on Figure 6.6-1,
where a transport block is generated by MAC by concatenating two RLC
PDUs from RB<em><sub>x</sub></em> and one RLC PDU from
RB<em><sub>y</sub></em>. The two RLC PDUs from RB<em><sub>x</sub></em>
each corresponds to one IP packet (<em>n</em> and <em>n+1</em>) while
the RLC PDU from RB<em><sub>y</sub></em> is a segment of an IP packet
(<em>m</em>).</p>

serving cell as depicted on Figures 6.7-1 and 6.7-2 below:</p>
<p>- In both uplink and downlink, there is one independent hybrid-ARQ
entity per serving cell and one transport block is generated per
assignment/grant per serving cell in the absence of spatial
multiplexing. Each transport block and its potential HARQ
retransmissions are mapped to a single serving cell.</p>

<p>When the UE is configured with SCG, the UE is configured with two MAC
entities: one MAC entity for the MCG and one MAC entity for the SCG.
Further details of DC operation can be found in TS 37.340 [21].</p>
<h2 id="supplementary-uplink-1">6.9 Supplementary Uplink</h2>
<p>In case of Supplementary Uplink (SUL, see TS 38.101-1 [18]), the UE
is configured with 2 ULs for one DL of the same cell, and uplink
transmissions on those two ULs are controlled by the network to avoid
overlapping PUSCH/PUCCH transmissions in time. Overlapping transmissions
on PUSCH are avoided through scheduling while overlapping transmissions
on PUCCH are avoided through configuration (PUCCH can only be configured
for only one of the 2 ULs of the cell). In addition, initial access is
supported in each of the uplink (see clause 9.2.6). An example of SUL is
given in Annex B.</p>
<h2 id="bandwidth-adaptation">6.10 Bandwidth Adaptation</h2>
<p>With Bandwidth Adaptation (BA), the receive and transmit bandwidth of
a UE need not be as large as the bandwidth of the cell and can be
adjusted: the width can be ordered to change (e.g. to shrink during
period of low activity to save power); the location can move in the
frequency domain (e.g. to increase scheduling flexibility); and the
subcarrier spacing can be ordered to change (e.g. to allow different
services). A subset of the total cell bandwidth of a cell is referred to
as a Bandwidth Part (BWP) and BA is achieved by configuring the UE with
BWP(s) and telling the UE which of the configured BWPs is currently the
active one.</p>
<p>Figure 6.10-1 below describes a scenario where 3 different BWPs are
configured:</p>
<p>- BWP<sub>1</sub> with a width of 40 MHz and subcarrier spacing of 15
kHz;</p>
<p>- BWP<sub>2</sub> with a width of 10 MHz and subcarrier spacing of 15

<h3 id="traffic-mapping-from-upper-layers-to-layer-2">6.11.2 Traffic
Mapping from Upper Layers to Layer-2</h3>
<p>In upstream direction, the IAB-donor-CU configures the IAB-node with
mappings between upstream F1 and non-F1 traffic originated at the
IAB-node, and the appropriate BAP routing ID, next-hop BAP address and
BH RLC channel. A specific mapping is configured:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- for each F1-U GTP-U tunnel;</p>
<p>- for non-UE associated F1AP messages;</p>
<p>- for UE-associated F1AP messages;</p>
<p>- for non-F1 traffic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Multiple mappings can contain the same BH RLC channel and/or next-hop
BAP address and/or BAP routing ID. In case the IAB-MT is
NR-dual-connected (SA mode only), the mapping may include two separate
BH RLC channels, where the two BH RLC channels are established toward
different parent nodes.</p>
<p>In case the IAB-node is configured with multiple IP addresses for
F1-C on the NR leg, multiple mappings can be configured for
non-UE-associated F1AP messages or UE-associated F1AP messages. The
appropriate mapping is selected based on the IAB-node's
implementation.</p>
<p>These traffic mapping configurations are performed via F1AP. For a
boundary IAB-node, the traffic mapping configuration includes
information that allows the boundary IAB-node to determine the IAB
topology the mapping applies to.</p>
<p>During IAB-node integration, a default BH RLC channel and a default
BAP routing ID may be configured via RRC, which can be used for non-F1-U
traffic. These default configurations may be updated during topology
adaptation scenarios as discussed in TS 38.401 [4].</p>
<p>In downstream direction, traffic mapping occurs internal to the
IAB-donor. Transport for IAB-donors that use split-gNB architecture is
handled in TS 38.401 [4].</p>

Routing, BAP Header Rewriting and BH-RLC-channel Mapping on BAP
sublayer</h3>
<p><img src="media/image31.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 6.11.3-1: Routing and BH RLC channel selection on BAP
sublayer</p>
<p>Routing on BAP sublayer uses the BAP routing ID, which is configured
by the IAB-donor-CU. The BAP routing ID consists of BAP address and BAP
path ID. The BAP address is used for the following purposes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Determination if a packet has reached the destination node, i.e.
IAB-node or IAB-donor-DU, on BAP sublayer. This is the case if the BAP
address in the packet's BAP header matches the BAP address configured
via RRC on the IAB-node, or via F1AP on the IAB-donor-DU. For a
dual-connected boundary IAB-node that is configured with two BAP
addresses, the BAP address in the packet's BAP header is matched with
the BAP address configured by the CU of the IAB topology, where the
packet has been received.</p>
<p>2. Determination of the next-hop node for packets that have not
reached their destination. This applies to packets arriving from a prior
hop on BAP sublayer or that have been received from IP layer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For packets arriving from a prior hop or from upper layers, the
determination of the next-hop node is based on a routing configuration
provided by the IAB-donor-CU via F1AP signalling or a default
configuration provided by the IAB-donor-CU via RRC signalling. This F1AP
configuration contains the mapping between the BAP routing ID carried in
the packet's BAP header and the next-hop node's BAP address.</p>

<p>The IAB-node resolves the next-hop BAP address to a physical backhaul
link. For this purpose, the IAB-donor-CU provides the
IAB-node/IAB-donor-DU with its child-node's BAP address via F1AP, and it
provides the IAB-node with its parent-node's BAP address via RRC. For a
boundary IAB-node, the routing configuration also indicates the IAB
topology it applies to. The BH link to the next-hop node and the
next-hop BAP address belong to the IAB topology of the CU that provided
the RRC configuration of the BH link to that next-hop node.</p>
<p>The IAB-node can receive multiple routing configurations with the
same destination BAP address but different BAP path IDs. These routing
configurations may resolve to the same or different egress BH links.</p>
<p>In case the BH link resolved from the routing entry is considered
<em>unavailable</em> for this packet, the IAB-node may perform local
rerouting as defined in TS38.340 [31], i.e., select another BH link by
considering only the packet's BAP address or, in some cases, by header
rewriting. In this manner, the packet can be delivered via an
alternative path as defined in TS 38.340 [31].</p>
<p>A BH link may be considered <em>unavailable</em> in case the BH link
has RLF. A parent link may be considered <em>unavailable</em> after a BH
RLF detection indication has been received on this parent link and
before a subsequent BH RLF recovery indication has been received on the
same parent link. For DL traffic, a BH link may be considered
<em>unavailable</em> for BAP PDUs carrying a certain BAP routing ID due
to congestion derived from flow-control feedback information related to
this BAP routing ID, as defined in TS 38.340 [31].</p>
<p>For a boundary IAB-node, the routing configuration may carry
information on the IAB topology the configuration applies to.</p>
<p>The IAB-node may rewrite the BAP routing ID in the packet's BAP
header under the following circumstances:</p>
<p>- A packet is routed between two IAB topologies via a boundary
IAB-node as defined in TS 38.401[31]. In this case, the BAP routing ID
carried by the received BAP PDU is allocated by the IAB-donor-CU of the
ingress IAB topology, while the BAP routing ID carried by the BAP PDU
after header rewriting is allocated by the IAB-donor-CU of the egress
IAB topology.</p>
<p>- An upstream packet is locally re-routed to a different IAB-donor-DU
than indicated by the BAP address in the BAP header of the received
packet. The rewritten BAP header carries the BAP address of the
alternative IAB-donor-DU and the BAP path ID for a path to this
alternative IAB-donor-DU. BAP header rewriting for upstream
inter-IAB-donor-DU local rerouting is only applied if neither routing
nor local re-routing without header rewriting resolve to an available
egress BH link.</p>
<p>For packets that are routed between two IAB topologies via a boundary
node, the BAP header rewriting configuration is provided via F1AP, and
it includes the ingress BAP routing ID, the egress BAP routing ID, and
it indicates the egress IAB topology:</p>

<p>For upstream packets that are locally re-routed to a different
IAB-donor-DU, the BAP header is rewritten with a BAP routing ID
contained in the routing entry that was selected for re-routing.</p>
<p>Details of BAP header rewriting are defined in TS 38.340 [31].</p>
<p>When routing a packet from an ingress to an egress BH link, the
IAB-node derives the egress BH RLC channel on the egress BH link through
an F1AP-configured mapping from the BH RLC channel used on the ingress
BH link. The BH RLC channel IDs used for ingress and egress BH RLC
channels are generated by the IAB-donor-CU. Since the BH RLC channel ID
only has link-local scope, the mapping configurations also include the
BAP addresses of prior and next hop:</p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>For a boundary IAB-node, the BH RLC channel mapping configuration may
also include indicators for the IAB topology of the ingress and of the
egress BH link.</p>
<p>The IAB-node resolves the BH RLC channel IDs from logical channel IDs
based on the configuration by the IAB-donor-CU. The IAB-MT obtains the
BH RLC channel ID in the RRC configuration of the corresponding logical
channel. The IAB-DU obtains the BH RLC channel ID in the F1AP
configuration of the BH RLC channel.</p>
<h2 id="multiple-transmitreceive-point-operation">6.12 Multiple
Transmit/Receive Point Operation</h2>
<p>In Multiple Transmit/Receive Point (multi-TRP) operation, a serving
cell can schedule the UE from two TRPs, providing better coverage,
reliability and/or data rates for PDSCH, PDCCH, PUSCH, and PUCCH.</p>
<p>There are two different operation modes to schedule multi-TRP PDSCH
transmissions: single-DCI and multi-DCI. For both modes, control of
uplink and downlink operation can be done by physical layer and MAC
layer, within the configuration provided by the RRC layer. In single-DCI
mode, the UE is scheduled by the same DCI for both TRPs and in multi-DCI
mode, the UE is scheduled by independent DCIs from each TRP.</p>
<p>There are two different operation modes for multi-TRP PDCCH: PDCCH
repetition as in Clause 5.2.3 and SFN based PDCCH transmission. In both
modes, the UE can receive two PDCCH transmissions, one from each TRP,
carrying the same DCI. In PDCCH repetition mode, the UE can receive the
two PDCCH transmissions carrying the same DCI from two linked search
spaces each associated with a different CORESET. In SFN based PDCCH
transmission mode, the UE can receive the two PDCCH transmissions
carrying the same DCI from a single search space/CORESET using different
TCI states.</p>
<p>For multi-TRP PUSCH repetition, according to indications in a single
DCI or in a semi-static configured grant provided over RRC, the UE
performs PUSCH transmission of the same contents toward two TRPs with
corresponding beam directions associated with different spatial
relations. For multi-TRP PUCCH repetition, the UE performs PUCCH
transmission of the same contents toward two TRPs with corresponding
beam directions associated with different spatial relations.</p>
<p>For inter-cell multi-TRP operation, for multi-DCI PDSCH transmission,
one or more TCI states can be associated with SSB with a PCI different
from the serving cell PCI. The activated TCI states can be associated
with at most one PCI different from the serving cell PCI at a time.</p>

<h2 id="system-information-handling">7.3 System Information
Handling</h2>
<h3 id="overview-2">7.3.1 Overview</h3>
<p>System Information (SI) consists of a MIB and a number of SIBs, which
are divided into Minimum SI and Other SI:</p>
<p>- <strong>Minimum SI</strong> comprises basic information required
for initial access and information for acquiring any other SI. Minimum
SI consists of:</p>
<p>- <em>MIB</em> contains cell barred status information and essential
physical layer information of the cell required to receive further
system information, e.g. CORESET#0 configuration. <em>MIB</em> is
periodically broadcast on BCH.</p>
<p>- <em>SIB1</em> defines the scheduling of other system information
blocks and contains information required for initial access. SIB1 is
also referred to as Remaining Minimum SI (RMSI) and is periodically
broadcast on DL-SCH or sent in a dedicated manner on DL-SCH to UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED.</p>
<p>- <strong>Other SI</strong> encompasses all SIBs not broadcast in the
Minimum SI. Those SIBs can either be periodically broadcast on DL-SCH,
broadcast on-demand on DL-SCH (i.e. upon request from UEs in RRC_IDLE,
RRC_INACTIVE, or RRC_CONNECTED), or sent in a dedicated manner on DL-SCH
to UEs in RRC_CONNECTED (i.e., upon request, if configured by the
network, from UEs in RRC_CONNECTED or when the UE has an active BWP with
no common search space configured or when the UE configured with inter
cell beam management is receiving DL-SCH from a TRP with PCI different
from serving cell's PCI). Other SI consists of:</p>
<p>- <em>SIB2</em> contains cell re-selection information, mainly
related to the serving cell;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB3</em> contains information about the serving frequency and
intra-frequency neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-selection
(including cell re-selection parameters common for a frequency as well
as cell specific re-selection parameters);</p>
<p>- <em>SIB4</em> contains information about other NR frequencies and
inter-frequency neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-selection
(including cell re-selection parameters common for a frequency as well
as cell specific re-selection parameters), which can also be used for NR
idle/inactive measurements;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB5</em> contains information about E-UTRA frequencies and
E-UTRA neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-selection (including cell
re-selection parameters common for a frequency as well as cell specific
re-selection parameters);</p>
<p>- <em>SIB6</em> contains an ETWS primary notification;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB7</em> contains an ETWS secondary notification;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB8</em> contains a CMAS warning notification;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB9</em> contains information related to GPS time and
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC);</p>
<p>- <em>SIB10</em> contains the Human-Readable Network Names (HRNN) of
the NPNs listed in SIB1;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB11</em> contains information related to idle/inactive
measurements;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB15</em> contains information related to disaster
roaming;</p>
<p><em>- SIB16</em> contains slice-based cell reselection
information;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB17</em> contains information related to TRS configuration
for UEs in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE;</p>
<p>- <em>SIBpos</em> contains positioning assistance data as defined in
TS 37.355 [43] and TS 38.331 [12];</p>
<p>- <em>SIB18</em> contains information related to the Group IDs for
Network selection (GINs) associated with SNPNs listed in SIB1.</p>
<p>For sidelink, Other SI also includes:</p>
<p>- <em>SIB12</em> contains information related to NR sidelink
communication;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB13</em> contains information related to
<em>SystemInformationBlockType21</em> for V2X sidelink communication as
specified in TS 36.331 clause 5.2.2.28 [29];</p>
<p>- <em>SIB14</em> contains information related to
<em>SystemInformationBlockType26</em> for V2X sidelink communication as
specified in TS 36.331 clause 5.2.2.33 [29].</p>
<p>For non-terrestrial network, Other SI also includes:</p>
<p>- <em>SIB19</em> contains NTN-specific parameters for serving cell
and optionally NTN-specific parameters for neighbour cells as defined in
TS 38.331 [12].</p>
<p>For MBS broadcast, Other SI also includes:</p>
<p>- <em>SIB20</em> contains MCCH configuration;</p>
<p>- <em>SIB21</em> contains information related to service continuity
for MBS broadcast reception.</p>
<p>Figure 7.3.1-1 below summarises System Information provisioning.</p>
<p><img src="media/image32.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 7.3.1-1: System Information Provisioning</p>
<p>For a cell/frequency that is considered for camping by the UE, the UE
is not required to acquire the contents of the minimum SI of that
cell/frequency from another cell/frequency layer. This does not preclude
the case that the UE applies stored SI from previously visited
cell(s).</p>
<p>If the UE cannot determine the full contents of the minimum SI of a
cell by receiving from that cell, the UE shall consider that cell as
barred.</p>
<p>In case of BA, the UE only acquires SI on the active BWP.</p>
<p>If the UE is configured with inter cell beam management:</p>
<p>- the UE is not required to acquire the SI from the serving cell
while it is receiving DL-SCH from a TRP with PCI different from serving
cell's PCI.</p>
<h3 id="scheduling">7.3.2 Scheduling</h3>
<p>The MIB is mapped on the BCCH and carried on BCH while all other SI
messages are mapped on the BCCH, where they are dynamically carried on
DL-SCH. The scheduling of SI messages part of Other SI is indicated by
<em>SIB1</em>.</p>
<p>For UEs in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is not
ongoing (see clause 18), a request for Other SI triggers a random access
procedure (see clause 9.2.6) where MSG3 includes the SI request message
unless the requested SI is associated to a subset of the PRACH
resources, in which case MSG1 is used for indication of the requested
Other SI. When MSG1 is used, the minimum granularity of the request is
one SI message (i.e. a set of SIBs), one RACH preamble and/or PRACH
resource can be used to request multiple SI messages and the gNB
acknowledges the request in MSG2. When MSG 3 is used, the gNB
acknowledges the request in MSG4.</p>
<p>For UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, a request for Other SI may be sent to the
network, if configured by the network, in a dedicated manner (i.e., via
UL-DCCH) and the granularity of the request is one SIB. The gNB may
respond with an <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> including the requested
SIB(s). It is a network choice to decide which requested SIBs are
delivered in a dedicated or broadcasted manner.</p>
<p>The Other SI may be broadcast at a configurable periodicity and for a
certain duration. The Other SI may also be broadcast when it is
requested by UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/RRC_CONNECTED.</p>
<p>For a UE to be allowed to camp on a cell it must have acquired the
contents of the Minimum SI from that cell. There may be cells in the
system that do not broadcast the Minimum SI and where the UE therefore
cannot camp.</p>
<h3 id="si-modification">7.3.3 SI Modification</h3>
<p>Change of system information (other than for ETWS/CMAS, see clause
16.4) only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a
modification period is used. System information may be transmitted a
number of times with the same content within a modification period, as
defined by its scheduling. The modification period is configured by
system information.</p>
<p>When the network changes (some of the) system information, it first
notifies the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a
modification period. In the next modification period, the network
transmits the updated system information. Upon receiving a change
notification, the UE acquires the new system information from the start
of the next modification period. The UE applies the previously acquired
system information until the UE acquires the new system information.</p>
<h2 id="access-control">7.4 Access Control</h2>
<p>NG-RAN supports overload and access control functionality such as
RACH back off, RRC Connection Reject, RRC Connection Release and UE
based access barring mechanisms.</p>
<p>One unified access control framework as specified in TS 22.261 [19]
applies to all UE states (RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED) for
NR. NG-RAN broadcasts barring control information associated with Access
Categories and Access Identities (in case of network sharing, the
barring control information can be set individually for each PLMN). The
UE determines whether an access attempt is authorized based on the
barring information broadcast for the selected PLMN, and the selected
Access Category and Access Identity(ies) for the access attempt:</p>
<p>- For NAS triggered requests, NAS determines the Access Category and
Access Identity(ies);</p>
<p>- For AS triggered requests, RRC determines the Access Category while
NAS determines the Access Identity(ies).</p>
<p>The gNB handles access attempts with establishment causes
"emergency", "mps-PriorityAccess" and "mcs-PriorityAccess" (i.e.
Emergency calls, MPS, MCS subscribers) with high priority and responds
with RRC Reject to these access attempts only in extreme network load
conditions that may threaten the gNB stability.</p>
<p>Unified access control does not apply to IAB-MTs.</p>
<h2 id="ue-capability-retrieval-framework">7.5 UE Capability Retrieval
framework</h2>
<p>The UE reports its UE radio access capabilities which are static at
least when the network requests. The gNB can request what capabilities
for the UE to report based on band information. The UE capability can be
represented by a capability ID, which may be exchanged in NAS signalling
over the air and in network signalling instead of the UE capability
structure.</p>
<p>In IAB, it is optional for an IAB-MT to support UE capability
Retrieval framework and the related signalling. In case IAB-MT does not
support UE capability Retrieval framework, IAB-MT capabilities are
assumed to be known to the network by other means, e.g. OAM.</p>
<h2 id="transport-of-nas-messages">7.6 Transport of NAS Messages</h2>
<p>NR provides reliable in-sequence delivery of NAS messages over SRBs
in RRC, except at handover where losses or duplication can occur when
PDCP is re-established. In RRC, NAS messages are sent in transparent
containers. Piggybacking of NAS messages can occur in the following
scenarios:</p>
<p>- At bearer establishment/modification/release in the DL;</p>
<p>- For transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup
and connection resume in the UL.</p>
<p>NOTE: In addition to the integrity protection and ciphering performed
by NAS, NAS messages can also be integrity protected and ciphered by
PDCP.</p>
<p>Multiple NAS messages can be sent in a single downlink RRC message
during PDU Session Resource establishment or modification. In this case,
the order of the NAS messages contained in the RRC message shall be in
the same order as that in the corresponding NG-AP message in order to
ensure the in-sequence delivery of NAS messages.</p>
<p>NG-RAN node may trigger the NAS Non Delivery Indication procedure to
report the non-delivery of the non PDU Session related NAS PDU received
from the AMF as specified in TS 38.413 [26].</p>
<h2 id="carrier-aggregation-3">7.7 Carrier Aggregation</h2>
<p>When CA is configured, the UE only has one RRC connection with the
network. At RRC connection establishment/re-establishment/handover, one
serving cell provides the NAS mobility information, and at RRC
connection re-establishment/handover, one serving cell provides the
security input. This cell is referred to as the Primary Cell (PCell).
Depending on UE capabilities, Secondary Cells (SCells) can be configured
to form together with the PCell a set of serving cells. The configured
set of serving cells for a UE therefore always consists of one PCell and
one or more SCells.</p>
<p>The reconfiguration, addition and removal of SCells can be performed
by RRC. At intra-NR handover and during connection resume from
RRC_INACTIVE, the network can also add, remove, keep, or reconfigure
SCells for usage with the target PCell. When adding a new SCell,
dedicated RRC signalling is used for sending all required system
information of the SCell i.e. while in connected mode, UEs need not
acquire broadcast system information directly from the SCells.</p>
<h2 id="bandwidth-adaptation-1">7.8 Bandwidth Adaptation</h2>
<p>To enable BA on the PCell, the gNB configures the UE with UL and DL
BWP(s). To enable BA on SCells in case of CA, the gNB configures the UE
with DL BWP(s) at least (i.e. there may be none in the UL). For the
PCell, the BWP used for initial access is configured via system
information. For the SCell(s), the BWP used after initial activation is
configured via dedicated RRC signalling.</p>
<p>In paired spectrum, DL and UL can switch BWP independently. In
unpaired spectrum, DL and UL switch BWP simultaneously. Switching
between configured BWPs happens by means of RRC signalling, DCI,
inactivity timer or upon initiation of random access. When an inactivity
timer is configured for a serving cell, the expiry of the inactivity
timer associated to that cell switches the active BWP to a default BWP
configured by the network. There can be at most one active BWP per cell,
except when the serving cell is configured with SUL, in which case there
can be at most one on each UL carrier.</p>
<h2 id="ue-assistance-information">7.9 UE Assistance Information</h2>
<p>When configured to do so, the UE can signal the network through
<em>UEAssistanceInformation</em>:</p>
<p>- If it prefers an adjustment in the connected mode DRX cycle length,
for the purpose of delay budget reporting;</p>
<p>- If it is experiencing internal overheating;</p>
<p>- If it prefers certain DRX parameter values, and/or a reduced
maximum number of secondary component carriers, and/or a reduced maximum
aggregated bandwidth and/or a reduced maximum number of MIMO layers
and/or minimum scheduling offsets K0 and K2 for power saving
purpose;</p>
<p>- If it expects not to send or receive any more data in the near
future, and in this case, it can provide its preference to transition
out of RRC_CONNECTED where this indication may express its preferred RRC
state, or alternately, it may cancel an earlier indicated preference to
transition out of RRC_CONNECTED;</p>
<p>- If it prefers (not) to be provisioned with reference time
information;</p>
<p>- If it prefers to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED state for MUSIM
operation and its preferred RRC state after transition;</p>
<p>- If it wants to include assistance information for setup or release
of gaps for MUSIM operation;</p>
<p>- The list of frequencies affected by IDC problems (see clause 23.4
of TS 36.300 [2]);</p>
<p>- Its RRM measurement relaxation status indicating whether RRM
measurement relaxation criteria are met or not;</p>
<p>- Its RLM measurement relaxation status indicating whether the UE is
applying RLM measurements relaxation;</p>
<p>- Its BFD measurement relaxation status indicating whether the UE is
applying BFD measurements relaxation.</p>
<p>NOTE: Only the Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) solution as
defined for E-UTRA in clause 23.4 of TS 36.300 [2] is used in NR. The
requirements on RRM/RLM/CSI measurements in different phases of IDC
interference defined in TS 36.300 [2] are applicable except that for NR
serving cell, the requirements in TS 38.133 [13] and TS 38.101-1 [18],
TS 38.101-2 [35], TS 38.101-3 [36] apply.</p>
<p>In the second case, the UE can express a preference for temporarily
reducing the number of maximum secondary component carriers, the maximum
aggregated bandwidth and the number of maximum MIMO layers. In all
cases, it is up to the gNB whether to accommodate the request.</p>
<p>For sidelink, the UE can report SL traffic pattern(s) to NG-RAN, for
periodic traffic.</p>
<h2 id="segmentation-of-rrc-messages">7.10 Segmentation of RRC
messages</h2>
<p>An RRC message may be segmented in case the size of the encoded RRC
message PDU exceeds the maximum PDCP SDU size. Segmentation is performed
in the RRC layer using a separate RRC PDU to carry each segment. The
receiver reassembles the segments to form the complete RRC message. All
segments of an RRC message are transmitted before sending another RRC
message. Segmentation is supported in both uplink and downlink as
specified in TS 38.331 [12].</p>

<p>NOTE 1: How to manage the scenario where a different PLMN ID has been
allocated by the operator for an NCGI is left to OAM and/or
implementation.</p>
<p>- gNB Identifier (gNB ID): used to identify gNBs within a PLMN. The
gNB ID is contained within the NCI of its cells.</p>
<p>- Global gNB ID: used to identify gNBs globally. The Global gNB ID is
constructed from the PLMN identity the gNB belongs to and the gNB ID.
The MCC and MNC are the same as included in the NCGI.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: It is not precluded that a cell served by a gNB does not
broadcast the PLMN ID included in the Global gNB ID.</p>
<p>- Tracking Area identity (TAI): used to identify tracking areas. The
TAI is constructed from the PLMN identity the tracking area belongs to
and the TAC (Tracking Area Code) of the Tracking Area.</p>
<p>- Single Network Slice Selection Assistance information (S-NSSAI):
identifies a network slice.</p>
<p>- Network Slice AS Group (NSAG): identifies an association to a slice
or a set of slices. An NSAG is defined within a TA, used for slice-based
cell reselection and/or slice-based RACH configuration. Values of NSAG
IDs associated with different slice or set of slices shall be unique
within a TA, also when slice-based cell reselection and slice-based RACH
configuration are both supported in the TA.</p>
<p>- Network Identifier (NID): identifies an SNPN in combination with a
PLMN ID.</p>
<p>- Closed Access Group Identifier: identifies a CAG within a PLMN.</p>
<p>- Local NG-RAN Node Identifier: used as reference to the NG-RAN node
in the I-RNTI.</p>

NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication related
identities</h2>
<p>The following identities are used for NR sidelink communication:</p>
<p>- Source Layer-2 ID: Identifies the sender of the data in NR sidelink
communication. The Source Layer-2 ID is 24 bits long and is split in the
MAC layer into two bit strings:</p>
<p>- One bit string is the LSB part (8 bits) of Source Layer-2 ID and
forwarded to physical layer of the sender. This identifies the source of
the intended data in sidelink control information and is used for
filtering of packets at the physical layer of the receiver;</p>
<p>- Second bit string is the MSB part (16 bits) of the Source Layer-2
ID and is carried within the MAC header. This is used for filtering of
packets at the MAC layer of the receiver.</p>
<p>- Destination Layer-2 ID: Identifies the target of the data in NR
sidelink communication. For NR sidelink communication, the Destination
Layer-2 ID is 24 bits long and is split in the MAC layer into two bit
strings:</p>
<p>- One bit string is the LSB part (16 bits) of Destination Layer-2 ID
and forwarded to physical layer of the sender. This identifies the
target of the intended data in sidelink control information and is used
for filtering of packets at the physical layer of the receiver;</p>
<p>- Second bit string is the MSB part (8 bits) of the Destination
Layer-2 ID and is carried within the MAC header. This is used for
filtering of packets at the MAC layer of the receiver.</p>
<p>- PC5 Link Identifier: Uniquely identifies the PC5 unicast link in a
UE for the lifetime of the PC5 unicast link as specified in TS 23.287
[40]. The PC5 Link Identifier is used to indicate to upper layers the
PC5 unicast link in which sidelink RLF was declared and corresponding
PC5-RRC connection was released.</p>
<p>V2X sidelink communication related identities are specified in clause
8.3 of TS 36.300 [2].</p>
<h1 id="mobility-and-state-transitions">9 Mobility and State
Transitions</h1>
<h2 id="overview-3">9.1 Overview</h2>
<p>Load balancing is achieved in NR with handover, redirection
mechanisms upon RRC release and through the usage of inter-frequency and
inter-RAT absolute priorities and inter-frequency Qoffset
parameters.</p>
<p>Measurements to be performed by a UE for connected mode mobility are
classified in at least four measurement types:</p>
<p>- Intra-frequency NR measurements;</p>
<p>- Inter-frequency NR measurements;</p>
<p>- Inter-RAT measurements for E-UTRA;</p>
<p>- Inter-RAT measurements for UTRA.</p>
<p>For each measurement type one or several measurement objects can be
defined (a measurement object defines e.g. the carrier frequency to be
monitored).</p>
<p>For each measurement object one or several reporting configurations
can be defined (a reporting configuration defines the reporting
criteria). Three reporting criteria are used: event triggered reporting,
periodic reporting and event triggered periodic reporting.</p>
<p>The association between a measurement object and a reporting
configuration is created by a measurement identity (a measurement
identity links together one measurement object and one reporting
configuration of the same RAT). By using several measurement identities
(one for each measurement object, reporting configuration pair) it is
then possible to:</p>
<p>- Associate several reporting configurations to one measurement
object and;</p>
<p>- Associate one reporting configuration to several measurement
objects.</p>
<p>The measurements identity is used as well when reporting results of
the measurements.</p>
<p>Measurement quantities are considered separately for each RAT.</p>
<p>Measurement commands are used by NG-RAN to order the UE to start,
modify or stop measurements.</p>
<p>Handover can be performed within the same RAT and/or CN, or it can
involve a change of the RAT and/or CN.</p>
<p>Inter system fallback towards E-UTRAN is performed when 5GC does not
support emergency services, voice services, for load balancing etc.
Depending on factors such as CN interface availability, network
configuration and radio conditions, the fallback procedure results in
either RRC_CONNECTED state mobility (handover procedure) or RRC_IDLE
state mobility (redirection), see TS 23.501 [3] and TS 38.331 [12].</p>
<p>SRVCC from 5G to UTRAN, if supported by both the UE and the network,
may be performed to handover a UE with an ongoing voice call from NR to
UTRAN. The overall procedure is described in TS 23.216 [34]. See also TS
38.331 [12] and TS 38.413 [26].</p>
<p>In the NG-C signalling procedure, the AMF based on support for
emergency services, voice service, any other services or for load
balancing etc, may indicate the target CN type as EPC or 5GC to the gNB
node. When the target CN type is received by gNB, the target CN type is
also conveyed to the UE in <em>RRCRelease</em> Message.</p>
<p>Inter-gNB CSI-RS based mobility, i.e. handover, is supported between
two neighbour gNBs by enabling that neighbour gNBs can exchange and
forward their own CSI-RS configurations and on/off status.</p>

<h3 id="mobility-in-rrc_idle">9.2.1 Mobility in RRC_IDLE</h3>
<h4 id="cell-selection">9.2.1.1 Cell Selection</h4>
<p>The principles of PLMN selection in NR are based on the 3GPP PLMN
selection principles. Cell selection is required on transition from
RM-DEREGISTERED to RM-REGISTERED, from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED and from
CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE and is based on the following principles:</p>
<p>- The UE NAS layer identifies a selected PLMN and equivalent
PLMNs;</p>
<p>- Cell selection is always based on CD-SSBs located on the
synchronization raster (see clause 5.2.4):</p>
<p>- The UE searches the NR frequency bands and for each carrier
frequency identifies the strongest cell as per the CD-SSB. It then reads
cell system information broadcast to identify its PLMN(s):</p>
<p>- The UE may search each carrier in turn ("initial cell selection")
or make use of stored information to shorten the search ("stored
information cell selection").</p>
<p>- The UE seeks to identify a suitable cell; if it is not able to
identify a suitable cell it seeks to identify an acceptable cell. When a
suitable cell is found or if only an acceptable cell is found it camps
on that cell and commence the cell reselection procedure:</p>
<p>- A suitable cell is one for which the measured cell attributes
satisfy the cell selection criteria; the cell PLMN is the selected PLMN,
registered or an equivalent PLMN; the cell is not barred or reserved and
the cell is not part of a tracking area which is in the list of
"forbidden tracking areas for roaming";</p>
<p>- An acceptable cell is one for which the measured cell attributes
satisfy the cell selection criteria and the cell is not barred.</p>
<p>- The IAB-MT applies the cell selection procedure as described for
the UE with the following differences:</p>
<p>- The IAB-MT ignores cell-barring or cell-reservation indications
contained in cell system information broadcast;</p>
<p>- The IAB-MT only considers a cell as a candidate for cell selection
if the cell system information broadcast indicates IAB support for the
selected PLMN or the selected SNPN.</p>
<p>Transition to RRC_IDLE:</p>
<p>On transition from RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE, a UE
should camp on a cell as result of cell selection according to the
frequency be assigned by RRC in the state transition message if any.</p>
<p>Recovery from out of coverage:</p>
<p>The UE should attempt to find a suitable cell in the manner described
for stored information or initial cell selection above. If no suitable
cell is found on any frequency or RAT, the UE should attempt to find an
acceptable cell.</p>
<p>In multi-beam operations, the cell quality is derived amongst the
beams corresponding to the same cell (see clause 9.2.4).</p>
<h4 id="cell-reselection">9.2.1.2 Cell Reselection</h4>
<p>A UE in RRC_IDLE performs cell reselection. The principles of the
procedure are the following:</p>
<p>- Cell reselection is always based on CD-SSBs located on the
synchronization raster (see clause 5.2.4).</p>
<p>- The UE makes measurements of attributes of the serving and
neighbour cells to enable the reselection process:</p>
<p>- For the search and measurement of inter-frequency neighbouring
cells, only the carrier frequencies need to be indicated.</p>
<p>- Cell reselection identifies the cell that the UE should camp on. It
is based on cell reselection criteria which involves measurements of the
serving and neighbour cells:</p>
<p>- Intra-frequency reselection is based on ranking of cells;</p>
<p>- Inter-frequency reselection is based on absolute priorities where a
UE tries to camp on the highest priority frequency available;</p>
<p>- A Neighbour Cell List (NCL) can be provided by the serving cell to
handle specific cases for intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring
cells;</p>
<p>- Exclude-lists can be provided to prevent the UE from reselecting to
specific intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells;</p>
<p>- Allow-lists can be provided to request the UE to reselect to only
specific intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells;</p>
<p>- Cell reselection can be speed dependent;</p>
<p>- Service specific prioritisation;</p>
<p>- Slice-based cell reselection information can be provided to
facilitate the UE to reselect a cell that supports specific slices.</p>
<p>In multi-beam operations, the cell quality is derived amongst the
beams corresponding to the same cell (see clause 9.2.4).</p>

<h3 id="mobility-in-rrc_inactive">9.2.2 Mobility in RRC_INACTIVE</h3>
<h4 id="overview-4">9.2.2.1 Overview</h4>
<p>RRC_INACTIVE is a state where a UE remains in CM-CONNECTED and can
move within an area configured by NG-RAN (the RNA) without notifying
NG-RAN. In RRC_INACTIVE, the last serving gNB node keeps the UE context
and the UE-associated NG connection with the serving AMF and UPF.</p>
<p>If the last serving gNB receives DL data from the UPF or DL
UE-associated signalling from the AMF (except the UE Context Release
Command message) while the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE, it pages in the cells
corresponding to the RNA and may send XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour
gNB(s) if the RNA includes cells of neighbour gNB(s).</p>
<p>Upon receiving the UE Context Release Command message while the UE is
in RRC_INACTIVE, the last serving gNB may page in the cells
corresponding to the RNA and may send XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour
gNB(s) if the RNA includes cells of neighbour gNB(s), in order to
release UE explicitly.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the NG RESET message while the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE,
the last serving gNB may page involved UEs in the cells corresponding to
the RNA and may send XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour gNB(s) if the RNA
includes cells of neighbour gNB(s) in order to explicitly release
involved UEs.</p>
<p>Upon RAN paging failure, the gNB behaves according to TS 23.501
[3].</p>
<p>The AMF provides to the NG-RAN node the Core Network Assistance
Information to assist the NG-RAN node's decision whether the UE can be
sent to RRC_INACTIVE, and to assist UE configuration and paging in
RRC_INACTIVE. The Core Network Assistance Information includes the
registration area configured for the UE, the Periodic Registration
Update timer, and the UE Identity Index value, and may include the UE
specific DRX, an indication if the UE is configured with Mobile
Initiated Connection Only (MICO) mode by the AMF, the Expected UE
Behaviour, the UE Radio Capability for Paging, the PEI with Paging
Subgrouping assistance information, the NR Paging eDRX Information, the
Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service and the Hashed UE Identity
Index Value. The UE registration area is taken into account by the
NG-RAN node when configuring the RNA. The UE specific DRX and UE
Identity Index value are used by the NG-RAN node for RAN paging. The
Periodic Registration Update timer is taken into account by the NG-RAN
node to configure Periodic RNA Update timer. The NG-RAN node takes into
account the Expected UE Behaviour to assist the UE RRC state transition
decision. The NG-RAN node may use the UE Radio Capability for Paging
during RAN Paging. The NG-RAN node takes into account the PEI with
Paging Subgrouping assistance information for subgroup paging in
RRC_INACTIVE except when the UE context contains an emergency PDU
session in which case the PEI with Paging Subgrouping assistance
information shall not be used according to TS 24.501 [28]. When sending
the XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour NG-RAN node(s), the PEI with Paging
Subgrouping assistance information may be included. The NG-RAN node
takes into account the NR Paging eDRX Information to configure the RAN
Paging when the NR UE is in RRC_INACTIVE. When sending XnAP RAN Paging
to neighbour NG-RAN node(s), the NR Paging eDRX Information for RRC_IDLE
and for RRC_INACTIVE may be included. The NG-RAN node takes into
consideration the Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service to include
the Paging Cause in RAN Paging for a UE in RRC_INACTIVE state. When
sending XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour NG-RAN node(s), the Paging Cause
may be included. When sending XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour NG-RAN
node(s), the Hashed UE Identity Index Value may be included to determine
the start point of PTW.</p>
<p>At transition to RRC_INACTIVE the NG-RAN node may configure the UE
with a periodic RNA Update timer value. At periodic RNA Update timer
expiry without notification from the UE, the gNB behaves as specified in
TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<p>If the UE accesses a gNB other than the last serving gNB, the
receiving gNB triggers the XnAP Retrieve UE Context procedure to get the
UE context from the last serving gNB and may also trigger an Xn-U
Address Indication procedure including tunnel information for potential
recovery of data from the last serving gNB. Upon successful UE context
retrieval, the receiving gNB shall perform the slice-aware admission
control in case of receiving slice information and becomes the serving
gNB and it further triggers the NGAP Path Switch Request and applicable
RRC procedures. After the path switch procedure, the serving gNB
triggers release of the UE context at the last serving gNB by means of
the XnAP UE Context Release procedure.</p>
<p>In case the UE is not reachable at the last serving gNB, the gNB
shall fail any AMF initiated UE-associated class 1 procedure which
allows the signalling of unsuccessful operation in the respective
response message. It may trigger the NAS Non Delivery Indication
procedure to report the non-delivery of any non PDU Session related NAS
PDU received from the AMF as specified in TS 38.413 [26].</p>
<p>If the UE accesses a gNB other than the last serving gNB and the
receiving gNB does not find a valid UE Context, the receiving gNB can
perform establishment of a new RRC connection instead of resumption of
the previous RRC connection. UE context retrieval will also fail and
hence a new RRC connection needs to be established if the serving AMF
changes.</p>
<p>A UE in the RRC_INACTIVE state is required to initiate RNA update
procedure when it moves out of the configured RNA. When receiving RNA
update request from the UE, the receiving gNB triggers the XnAP Retrieve
UE Context procedure to get the UE context from the last serving gNB and
may decide to send the UE back to RRC_INACTIVE state, move the UE into
RRC_CONNECTED state, or send the UE to RRC_IDLE. In case of periodic RNA
update, if the last serving gNB decides not to relocate the UE context,
it fails the Retrieve UE Context procedure and sends the UE back to
RRC_INACTIVE, or to RRC_IDLE directly by an encapsulated
<em>RRCRelease</em> message.</p>
<h4 id="cell-reselection-1">9.2.2.2 Cell Reselection</h4>
<p>A UE in RRC_INACTIVE performs cell reselection. The principles of the
procedure are as for the RRC_IDLE state (see clause 9.2.1.2).</p>
<h4 id="ran-based-notification-area">9.2.2.3 RAN-Based Notification
Area</h4>
<p>A UE in the RRC_INACTIVE state can be configured by the last serving
NG-RAN node with an RNA, where:</p>
<p>- the RNA can cover a single or multiple cells, and shall be
contained within the CN registration area; in this release Xn
connectivity should be available within the RNA;</p>
<p>- a RAN-based notification area update (RNAU) is periodically sent by
the UE and is also sent when the cell reselection procedure of the UE
selects a cell that does not belong to the configured RNA.</p>
<p>There are several different alternatives on how the RNA can be
configured:</p>
<p>- List of cells:</p>
<p>- A UE is provided an explicit list of cells (one or more) that
constitute the RNA.</p>
<p>- List of RAN areas:</p>
<p>- A UE is provided (at least one) RAN area ID, where a RAN area is a
subset of a CN Tracking Area or equal to a CN Tracking Area. A RAN area
is specified by one RAN area ID, which consists of a TAC and optionally
a RAN area Code;</p>
<p>- A cell broadcasts one or, in case of network sharing with multiple
cell ID broadcast, more RAN area IDs in the system information.</p>
<p>NG-RAN may provide different RNA definitions to different UEs but not
mix different definitions to the same UE at the same time. UE shall
support all RNA configuration options listed above.</p>

to reject the Resume Request right away and keep the UE in RRC_INACTIVE
without any reconfiguration (e.g. as described in the two examples
below), or when the gNB decides to setup a new RRC connection, SRB0
(without security) is used. Conversely, when the gNB decides to
reconfigure the UE (e.g. with a new DRX cycle or RNA) or when the gNB
decides to push the UE to RRC_IDLE, SRB1 (with integrity protection and
ciphering as previously configured for that SRB) shall be used.</p>
<p>NOTE: SRB1 can only be used once the UE Context is retrieved i.e.
after step 3.</p>

<h3 id="mobility-in-rrc_connected">9.2.3 Mobility in RRC_CONNECTED</h3>
<h4 id="overview-5">9.2.3.1 Overview</h4>
<p>Network controlled mobility applies to UEs in RRC_CONNECTED and is
categorized into two types of mobility: cell level mobility and beam
level mobility. Beam level mobility includes intra-cell beam level
mobility and inter-cell beam level mobility.</p>
<p><strong>Cell Level Mobility</strong> requires explicit RRC signalling
to be triggered, i.e. handover. For inter-gNB handover, the signalling
procedures consist of at least the following elemental components
illustrated in Figure 9.2.3.1-1:</p>
<p><img src="media/image43.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 9.2.3.1-1: Inter-gNB handover procedures</p>
<p>1. The source gNB initiates handover and issues a HANDOVER REQUEST
over the Xn interface.</p>
<p>2. The target gNB performs admission control and provides the new RRC
configuration as part of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE.</p>
<p>3. The source gNB provides the RRC configuration to the UE by
forwarding the <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message received in the
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE. The <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message
includes at least cell ID and all information required to access the
target cell so that the UE can access the target cell without reading
system information. For some cases, the information required for
contention-based and contention-free random access can be included in
the <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message. The access information to the
target cell may include beam specific information, if any.</p>
<p>4. The UE moves the RRC connection to the target gNB and replies with
the <em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em>.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: User Data can also be sent in step 4 if the grant allows.</p>
<p>In case of DAPS handover, the UE continues the downlink user data
reception from the source gNB until releasing the source cell and
continues the uplink user data transmission to the source gNB until
successful random access procedure to the target gNB.</p>
<p>Only source and target PCell are used during DAPS handover. CA, DC,
SUL, multi-TRP, EHC, CHO, UDC, NR sidelink configurations and V2X
sidelink configurations are released by the source gNB before the
handover command is sent to the UE and are not configured by the target
gNB until the DAPS handover has completed (i.e. at earliest in the same
message that releases the source PCell).</p>
<p>The handover mechanism triggered by RRC requires the UE at least to
reset the MAC entity and re-establish RLC, except for DAPS handover,
where upon reception of the handover command, the UE:</p>
<p>- Creates a MAC entity for target;</p>
<p>- Establishes the RLC entity and an associated DTCH logical channel
for target for each DRB configured with DAPS;</p>
<p>- For each DRB configured with DAPS, reconfigures the PDCP entity
with separate security and ROHC functions for source and target and
associates them with the RLC entities configured by source and target
respectively;</p>
<p>- Retains the rest of the source configurations until release of the
source.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: Void.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: Void.</p>
<p>RRC managed handovers with and without PDCP entity re-establishment
are both supported. For DRBs using RLC AM mode, PDCP can either be
re-established together with a security key change or initiate a data
recovery procedure without a key change. For DRBs using RLC UM mode,
PDCP can either be re-established together with a security key change or
remain as it is without a key change. For SRBs, PDCP can either remain
as it is, discard its stored PDCP PDUs/SDUs without a key change or be
re-established together with a security key change.</p>
<p>Data forwarding, in-sequence delivery and duplication avoidance at
handover can be guaranteed when the target gNB uses the same DRB
configuration as the source gNB.</p>
<p>Timer based handover failure procedure is supported in NR. RRC
connection re-establishment procedure is used for recovering from
handover failure except in certain CHO or DAPS handover scenarios:</p>
<p>- When DAPS handover fails, the UE falls back to the source cell
configuration, resumes the connection with the source cell, and reports
DAPS handover failure via the source without triggering RRC connection
re-establishment if the source link has not been released.</p>
<p>- When initial CHO execution attempt fails or HO fails, the UE
performs cell selection, and if the selected cell is a CHO candidate and
if network configured the UE to try CHO after handover/CHO failure, then
the UE attempts CHO execution once, otherwise re-establishment is
performed.</p>
<p>DAPS handover for FR2 to FR2 case is not supported in this release of
the specification.</p>
<p>The handover of the IAB-MT in SA mode follows the same procedure as
described for the UE. After the backhaul has been established, the
handover of the IAB-MT is part of the intra-CU topology adaptation
procedure defined in TS 38.401 [4]. Modifications to the configuration
of BAP sublayer and higher protocol layers above the BAP sublayer are
described in TS 38.401 [4].</p>
<p><strong>Beam Level Mobility</strong> does not require explicit RRC
signalling to be triggered. Beam level mobility can be within a cell, or
between cells, the latter is referred to as inter-cell beam management
(ICBM). For ICBM, a UE can receive or transmit UE dedicated
channels/signals via a TRP associated with a PCI different from the PCI
of a serving cell, while non-UE-dedicated channels/signals can only be
received via a TRP associated with a PCI of the serving cell. The gNB
provides via RRC signalling the UE with measurement configuration
containing configurations of SSB/CSI resources and resource sets,
reports and trigger states for triggering channel and interference
measurements and reports. In case of ICBM, a measurement configuration
includes SSB resources associated with PCIs different from the PCI of a
serving cell. Beam Level Mobility is then dealt with at lower layers by
means of physical layer and MAC layer control signalling, and RRC is not
required to know which beam is being used at a given point in time.</p>
<p>SSB-based Beam Level Mobility is based on the SSB associated to the
initial DL BWP and can only be configured for the initial DL BWPs and
for DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP.
For other DL BWPs, Beam Level Mobility can only be performed based on
CSI-RS.</p>
<h4 id="handover">9.2.3.2 Handover</h4>
<h5 id="c-plane-handling">9.2.3.2.1 C-Plane Handling</h5>
<p>The intra-NR RAN handover performs the preparation and execution
phase of the handover procedure performed without involvement of the
5GC, i.e. preparation messages are directly exchanged between the gNBs.
The release of the resources at the source gNB during the handover
completion phase is triggered by the target gNB. The figure below
depicts the basic handover scenario where neither the AMF nor the UPF
changes:</p>
<p><img src="media/image44.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 9.2.3.2.1-1: Intra-AMF/UPF Handover</p>
<p>0. The UE context within the source gNB contains information
regarding roaming and access restrictions which were provided either at
connection establishment or at the last TA update.</p>
<p>1. The source gNB configures the UE measurement procedures and the UE
reports according to the measurement configuration.</p>
<p>2. The source gNB decides to handover the UE, based on
<em>MeasurementReport</em> and RRM information.</p>
<p>3. The source gNB issues a Handover Request message to the target gNB
passing a transparent RRC container with necessary information to
prepare the handover at the target side. The information includes at
least the target cell ID, KgNB*, the C-RNTI of the UE in the source gNB,
RRM-configuration including UE inactive time, basic AS-configuration
including <em>antenna Info and DL Carrier Frequency</em>, the current
QoS flow to DRB mapping rules applied to the UE, the SIB1 information
from source gNB, the UE capabilities for different RATs, PDU session
related information, and can include the UE reported measurement
information including beam-related information if available. The PDU
session related information includes the slice information and QoS flow
level QoS profile(s). The source gNB may also request a DAPS handover
for one or more DRBs.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: After issuing a Handover Request, the source gNB should not
reconfigure the UE, including performing Reflective QoS flow to DRB
mapping.</p>
<p>4. Admission Control may be performed by the target gNB. Slice-aware
admission control shall be performed if the slice information is sent to
the target gNB. If the PDU sessions are associated with non-supported
slices the target gNB shall reject such PDU Sessions.</p>
<p>5. The target gNB prepares the handover with L1/L2 and sends the
HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE to the source gNB, which includes a
transparent container to be sent to the UE as an RRC message to perform
the handover. The target gNB also indicates if a DAPS handover is
accepted.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: As soon as the source gNB receives the HANDOVER REQUEST
ACKNOWLEDGE, or as soon as the transmission of the handover command is
initiated in the downlink, data forwarding may be initiated.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE 3: For DRBs configured with DAPS, downlink PDCP SDUs are
forwarded with SN assigned by the source gNB, until SN assignment is
handed over to the target gNB in step 8b, for which the normal data
forwarding follows as defined in 9.2.3.2.3.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>6. The source gNB triggers the Uu handover by sending an
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to the UE, containing the
information required to access the target cell: at least the target cell
ID, the new C-RNTI, the target gNB security algorithm identifiers for
the selected security algorithms. It can also include a set of dedicated
RACH resources, the association between RACH resources and SSB(s), the
association between RACH resources and UE-specific CSI-RS
configuration(s), common RACH resources, and system information of the
target cell, etc.</p>
<p>NOTE 4: For DRBs configured with DAPS, the source gNB does not stop
transmitting downlink packets until it receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS
message from the target gNB in step 8a.</p>
<p>NOTE 4a: CHO cannot be configured simultaneously with DAPS
handover.</p>
<p>7a. For DRBs configured with DAPS, the source gNB sends the EARLY
STATUS TRANSFER message. The DL COUNT value conveyed in the EARLY STATUS
TRANSFER message indicates PDCP SN and HFN of the first PDCP SDU that
the source gNB forwards to the target gNB. The source gNB does not stop
assigning SNs to downlink PDCP SDUs until it sends the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message to the target gNB in step 8b.</p>
<p>7. For DRBs not configured with DAPS, the source gNB sends the SN
STATUS TRANSFER message to the target gNB to convey the uplink PDCP SN
receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN transmitter status of DRBs for
which PDCP status preservation applies (i.e. for RLC AM). The uplink
PDCP SN receiver status includes at least the PDCP SN of the first
missing UL PDCP SDU and may include a bit map of the receive status of
the out of sequence UL PDCP SDUs that the UE needs to retransmit in the
target cell, if any. The downlink PDCP SN transmitter status indicates
the next PDCP SN that the target gNB shall assign to new PDCP SDUs, not
having a PDCP SN yet.</p>
<p>NOTE 5: In case of DAPS handover, the uplink PDCP SN receiver status
and the downlink PDCP SN transmitter status for a DRB with RLC-AM and
not configured with DAPS may be transferred by the SN STATUS TRANSFER
message in step 8b instead of step 7.</p>
<p>NOTE 6: For DRBs configured with DAPS, the source gNB may
additionally send the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message(s) between step 7
and step 8b, to inform discarding of already forwarded PDCP SDUs. The
target gNB does not transmit forwarded downlink PDCP SDUs to the UE,
whose COUNT is less than the conveyed DL COUNT value and discards them
if transmission has not been attempted already.</p>
<p>8. The UE synchronises to the target cell and completes the RRC
handover procedure by sending <em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em>
message to target gNB. In case of DAPS handover, the UE does not detach
from the source cell upon receiving the <em>RRCReconfiguration</em>
message. The UE releases the source resources and configurations and
stops DL/UL reception/transmission with the source upon receiving an
explicit release from the target node.</p>
<p>NOTE 6a: From RAN point of view, the DAPS handover is considered to
only be completed after the UE has released the source cell as
explicitly requested from the target node. RRC suspend, a subsequent
handover or inter-RAT handover cannot be initiated until the source cell
has been released.</p>
<p>8a/b In case of DAPS handover, the target gNB sends the HANDOVER
SUCCESS message to the source gNB to inform that the UE has successfully
accessed the target cell. In return, the source gNB sends the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message for DRBs configured with DAPS for which the description
in step 7 applies, and the normal data forwarding follows as defined in
9.2.3.2.3.</p>
<p>NOTE 7: The uplink PDCP SN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN
transmitter status are also conveyed for DRBs with RLC-UM in the SN
STATUS TRANSFER message in step 8b, if configured with DAPS.</p>
<p>NOTE 8: For DRBs configured with DAPS, the source gNB does not stop
delivering uplink QoS flows to the UPF until it sends the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message in step 8b. The target gNB does not forward QoS flows
of the uplink PDCP SDUs successfully received in-sequence to the UPF
until it receives the SN STATUS TRANSFER message, in which UL HFN and
the first missing SN in the uplink PDCP SN receiver status indicates the
start of uplink PDCP SDUs to be delivered to the UPF. The target gNB
does not deliver any uplink PDCP SDUs which has an UL COUNT lower than
the provided.</p>
<p>NOTE 9: Void.</p>
<p>9. The target gNB sends a PATH SWITCH REQUEST message to AMF to
trigger 5GC to switch the DL data path towards the target gNB and to
establish an NG-C interface instance towards the target gNB.</p>
<p>10. 5GC switches the DL data path towards the target gNB. The UPF
sends one or more "end marker" packets on the old path to the source gNB
per PDU session/tunnel and then can release any U-plane/TNL resources
towards the source gNB.</p>
<p>11. The AMF confirms the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message with the PATH
SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.</p>
<p>12. Upon reception of the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message
from the AMF, the target gNB sends the UE CONTEXT RELEASE to inform the
source gNB about the success of the handover. The source gNB can then
release radio and C-plane related resources associated to the UE
context. Any ongoing data forwarding may continue.</p>
<p>The RRM configuration can include both beam measurement information
(for layer 3 mobility) associated to SSB(s) and CSI-RS(s) for the
reported cell(s) if both types of measurements are available. Also, if
CA is configured, the RRM configuration can include the list of best
cells on each frequency for which measurement information is available.
And the RRM measurement information can also include the beam
measurement for the listed cells that belong to the target gNB.</p>
<p>The common RACH configuration for beams in the target cell is only
associated to the SSB(s). The network can have dedicated RACH
configurations associated to the SSB(s) and/or have dedicated RACH
configurations associated to CSI-RS(s) within a cell. The target gNB can
only include one of the following RACH configurations in the Handover
Command to enable the UE to access the target cell:</p>
<p>i) Common RACH configuration;</p>
<p>ii) Common RACH configuration + Dedicated RACH configuration
associated with SSB;</p>
<p>iii) Common RACH configuration + Dedicated RACH configuration
associated with CSI-RS.</p>
<p>The dedicated RACH configuration allocates RACH resource(s) together
with a quality threshold to use them. When dedicated RACH resources are
provided, they are prioritized by the UE and the UE shall not switch to
contention-based RACH resources as long as the quality threshold of
those dedicated resources is met. The order to access the dedicated RACH
resources is up to UE implementation.</p>
<p>Upon receiving a handover command requesting DAPS handover, the UE
suspends source cell SRBs, stops sending and receiving any RRC control
plane signalling toward the source cell, and establishes SRBs for the
target cell. The UE releases the source cell SRBs configuration upon
receiving source cell release indication from the target cell after
successful DAPS handover execution. When DAPS handover to the target
cell fails and if the source cell link is available, then the UE reverts
back to the source cell configuration and resumes source cell SRBs for
control plane signalling transmission.</p>
<h5 id="u-plane-handling">9.2.3.2.2 U-Plane Handling</h5>
<p>The U-plane handling during the Intra-NR-Access mobility activity for
UEs in RRC_CONNECTED takes the following principles into account to
avoid data loss during HO:</p>
<p>- During HO preparation, U-plane tunnels can be established between
the source gNB and the target gNB;</p>
<p>- During HO execution, user data can be forwarded from the source gNB
to the target gNB;</p>
<p>- Forwarding should take place in order as long as packets are
received at the source gNB from the UPF or the source gNB buffer has not
been emptied.</p>
<p>- During HO completion:</p>
<p>- The target gNB sends a path switch request message to the AMF to
inform that the UE has gained access and the AMF then triggers path
switch related 5GC internal signalling and actual path switch of the
source gNB to the target gNB in UPF;</p>
<p>- The source gNB should continue forwarding data as long as packets
are received at the source gNB from the UPF or the source gNB buffer has
not been emptied.</p>
<p><strong>For RLC-AM bearers</strong>:</p>
<p>- For in-sequence delivery and duplication avoidance, PDCP SN is
maintained on a per DRB basis and the source gNB informs the target gNB
about the next DL PDCP SN to allocate to a packet which does not have a
PDCP sequence number yet (either from source gNB or from the UPF).</p>
<p>- For security synchronisation, HFN is also maintained and the source
gNB provides to the target one reference HFN for the UL and one for the
DL i.e. HFN and corresponding SN.</p>
<p>- In both the UE and the target gNB, a window-based mechanism is used
for duplication detection and reordering.</p>
<p>- The occurrence of duplicates over the air interface in the target
gNB is minimised by means of PDCP SN based reporting at the target gNB
by the UE. In uplink, the reporting is optionally configured on a per
DRB basis by the gNB and the UE should first start by transmitting those
reports when granted resources are in the target gNB. In downlink, the
gNB is free to decide when and for which bearers a report is sent and
the UE does not wait for the report to resume uplink transmission.</p>
<p>- The target gNB re-transmits and prioritizes all downlink data
forwarded by the source gNB (i.e. the target gNB should first send all
forwarded PDCP SDUs with PDCP SNs, then all forwarded downlink PDCP SDUs
without SNs before sending new data from 5GC), excluding PDCP SDUs for
which the reception was acknowledged through PDCP SN based reporting by
the UE.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Lossless delivery when a QoS flow is mapped to a different
DRB at handover, requires the old DRB to be configured in the target
cell. For in-order delivery in the DL, the target gNB should first
transmit the forwarded PDCP SDUs on the old DRB before transmitting new
data from 5GC on the new DRB. In the UL, the target gNB should not
deliver data of the QoS flow from the new DRB to 5GC before receiving
the end marker on the old DRB from the UE.</p>
<p>- The UE re-transmits in the target gNB all uplink PDCP SDUs starting
from the oldest PDCP SDU that has not been acknowledged at RLC in the
source, excluding PDCP SDUs for which the reception was acknowledged
through PDCP SN based reporting by the target.</p>
<p>- In case of handovers involving Full Configuration, the following
description below for RLC-UM bearers applies for RLC-AM bearers instead.
Data loss may happen.</p>
<p><strong>For RLC-UM bearers</strong>:</p>
<p>- The PDCP SN and HFN are reset in the target gNB, unless the bearer
is configured with DAPS handover;</p>
<p>- No PDCP SDUs are retransmitted in the target gNB;</p>
<p>- The target gNB prioritises all downlink SDAP SDUs forwarded by the
source gNB over the data from the core network;</p>
<p>NOTE 2: To minimise losses when a QoS flow is mapped to a different
DRB at handover, the old DRB needs to be configured in the target cell.
For in-order delivery in the DL, the target gNB should first transmit
the forwarded PDCP SDUs on the old DRB before transmitting new data from
5GC on the new DRB. In the UL, the target gNB should not deliver data of
the QoS flow from the new DRB to 5GC before receiving the end marker on
the old DRB from the UE.</p>
<p>- The UE does not retransmit any PDCP SDU in the target cell for
which transmission had been completed in the source cell.</p>
<p><strong>For DAPS handover:</strong></p>
<p>A DAPS handover can be used for an RLC-AM or RLC-UM bearer. For a DRB
configured with DAPS, the following principles are additionally
applied.</p>
<p>Downlink:</p>
<p>- During HO preparation, a forwarding tunnel is always
established.</p>
<p>- The source gNB is responsible for allocating downlink PDCP SNs
until the SN assignment is handed over to the target gNB and data
forwarding in 9.2.3.2.3 takes place. That is, the source gNB does not
stop assigning PDCP SNs to downlink packets until it receives the
HANDOVER SUCCESS message and sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the
target gNB.</p>
<p>- Upon allocation of downlink PDCP SNs by the source gNB, it starts
scheduling downlink data on the source radio link and also starts
forwarding downlink PDCP SDUs along with assigned PDCP SNs to the target
gNB.</p>
<p>- For security synchronisation, HFN is maintained for the forwarded
downlink SDUs with PDCP SNs assigned by the source gNB. The source gNB
sends the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message to convey the DL COUNT value,
indicating PDCP SN and HFN of the first PDCP SDU that the source gNB
forwards to the target gNB.</p>
<p>- HFN and PDCP SN are maintained after the SN assignment is handed
over to the target gNB. The SN STATUS TRANSFER message indicates the
next DL PDCP SN to allocate to a packet which does not have a PDCP
sequence number yet, even for RLC-UM.</p>
<p>- During handover execution period, the source and target gNBs
separately perform ROHC header compression, ciphering, and adding PDCP
header.</p>
<p>- During handover execution period, the UE continues to receive
downlink data from both source and target gNBs until the source gNB
connection is released by an explicit release command from the target
gNB.</p>
<p>- During handover execution period, the UE PDCP entity configured
with DAPS maintains separate security and ROHC header decompression
functions associated with each gNB, while maintaining common functions
for reordering, duplicate detection and discard, and PDCP SDUs
in-sequence delivery to upper layers. PDCP SN continuity is supported
for both RLC AM and UM DRBs configured with DAPS.</p>
<p>Uplink:</p>
<p>- The UE transmits UL data to the source gNB until the random access
procedure toward the target gNB has been successfully completed.
Afterwards the UE switches its UL data transmission to the target
gNB.</p>
<p>- Even after switching its UL data transmissions towards the target
gNB, the UE continues to send UL layer 1 CSI feedback, HARQ feedback,
layer 2 RLC feedback, ROHC feedback, HARQ data (re-)transmissions, and
RLC data (re-)transmissions to the source gNB.</p>
<p>- During handover execution period, the UE maintains separate
security context and ROHC header compressor context for uplink
transmissions towards the source and target gNBs. The UE maintains
common UL PDCP SN allocation. PDCP SN continuity is supported for both
RLC AM and UM DRBs configured with DAPS.</p>
<p>- During handover execution period, the source and target gNBs
maintain their own security and ROHC header decompressor contexts to
process UL data received from the UE.</p>
<p>- The establishment of a forwarding tunnel is optional.</p>
<p>- HFN and PDCP SN are maintained in the target gNB. The SN STATUS
TRANSFER message indicates the COUNT of the first missing PDCP SDU that
the target should start delivering to the 5GC, even for RLC-UM.</p>
<h5 id="data-forwarding">9.2.3.2.3 Data Forwarding</h5>
<p>The following description depicts the data forwarding principles for
intra-system handover.</p>
<p>The source NG-RAN node may suggest downlink data forwarding per QoS
flow established for a PDU session and may provide information how it
maps QoS flows to DRBs. The target NG-RAN node decides data forwarding
per QoS flow established for a PDU Session.</p>
<p>If "lossless handover" is required and the QoS flows to DRB mapping
applied at the target NG-RAN node allows applying for data forwarding
the same QoS flows to DRB mapping as applied at the source NG-RAN node
for a DRB and if all QoS flows mapped to that DRB are accepted for data
forwarding, the target NG-RAN node establishes a downlink forwarding
tunnel for that DRB.</p>
<p>For a DRB for which preservation of SN status applies, the target
NG-RAN node may decide to establish an UL data forwarding tunnel.</p>
<p>The target NG-RAN node may also decide to establish a downlink
forwarding tunnel for each PDU session. In this case the target NG-RAN
node provides information for which QoS flows data forwarding has been
accepted and corresponding UP TNL information for data forwarding
tunnels to be established between the source NG-RAN node and the target
NG-RAN node.</p>
<p>If QoS flows have been re-mapped at the source NG-RAN node and user
packets along the old source mapping are still being processed at
handover preparation, and if the source NG-RAN node has not yet received
the SDAP end marker for certain QoS flows when providing the SN status
to the target NG-RAN node, the source NG-RAN node provides the old side
QoS mapping information for UL QoS flows to the target NG-RAN node for
which no SDAP end marker was yet received. The target NG-RAN will
receive for those QoS flows the end marker when the UE finalises to send
UL user data according to the old source side mapping.</p>
<p>The source NG-RAN node may also propose to establish uplink
forwarding tunnels for some PDU sessions in order to transfer SDAP SDUs
corresponding to QoS flows for which flow re-mapping happened before the
handover and the SDAP end marker has not yet been received, and for
which user data was received at the source NG-RAN node via the DRB to
which the QoS flow was remapped. If accepted the target NG-RAN node
shall provide the corresponding UP TNL information for data forwarding
tunnels to be established between the source NG-RAN node and the target
NG-RAN node.</p>
<p>As long as data forwarding of DL user data packets takes place, the
source NG-RAN node shall forward user data in the same forwarding
tunnel, i.e.</p>
<p>- for any QoS flow accepted for data forwarding by the target NG-RAN
node and for which a DRB DL forwarding tunnel was established for a DRB
to which this QoS flow was mapped at the source NG-RAN node, any fresh
packets of this QoS flow shall be forwarded as PDCP SDUs via the mapped
DRB DL forwarding tunnel.</p>
<p>- for DRBs for which preservation of SN status applies, the source
NG-RAN node may forward in order to the target NG-RAN node via the DRB
DL forwarding tunnel all downlink PDCP SDUs with their SN corresponding
to PDCP PDUs which have not been acknowledged by the UE.</p>
<p>NOTE: The SN of forwarded PDCP SDUs is carried in the "PDCP PDU
number" field of the GTP-U extension header.</p>
<p>- for any QoS flow accepted for data forwarding by the target NG-RAN
node for which a DL PDU session forwarding tunnel was established, the
source NG-RAN node forwards SDAP SDUs as received on NG-U from the
UPF.</p>
<p>For handovers involving Full Configuration, the source NG-RAN node
behaviour is unchanged from the description above. In case a DRB DL
forwarding tunnel was established, the target NG-RAN node may identify
the PDCP SDUs for which delivery was attempted by the source NG-RAN
node, by the presence of the PDCP SN in the forwarded GTP-U packet and
may discard them.</p>
<p>As long as data forwarding of UL user data packets takes place for
DRBs for which preservation of SN status applies the source NG-RAN node
either:</p>
<p>- discards the uplink PDCP PDUs received out of sequence if the
source NG-RAN node has not accepted the request from the target NG-RAN
node for uplink forwarding or if the target NG-RAN node has not
requested uplink forwarding for the bearer during the Handover
Preparation procedure; or</p>
<p>- forwards to the target NG-RAN node via the corresponding DRB UL
forwarding tunnel, the uplink PDCP SDUs with their SN corresponding to
PDCP PDUs received out of sequence if the source NG-RAN node has
accepted the request from the target NG-RAN node for uplink forwarding
for the bearer during the Handover Preparation procedure, including PDCP
SDUs corresponding to user data of those QoS flows, for which re-mapping
happened for a QoS flow before the handover and the SDAP end marker has
not yet been received at the source NG-RAN node.</p>
<p>As long as data forwarding of UL user data packets takes place for a
PDU session, the source NG-RAN node forwards via the corresponding PDU
session UL forwarding tunnel, the uplink SDAP SDUs corresponding to QoS
flows for which flow re-mapping happened before the handover and the
SDAP end marker has not yet been received at the source NG-RAN node, and
which were received at the source NG-RAN node via the DRB to which the
QoS flow was remapped.</p>
<p>For DRBs configured with DAPS handover, data forwarding after the
source gNB receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message from the target gNB
follows the same behaviors as described above.</p>
<p>For DRBs configured with DAPS handover, before the source gNB
receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message:</p>
<p>- The source gNB may forward to the target gNB downlink PDCP SDUs
with SNs assigned by the source gNB. No downlink PDCP SDU without a SN
assigned or SDAP SDU is forwarded. No uplink PDCP SDU or SDAP SDU is
forwarded.</p>
<p>- The source gNB sends the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message to maintain
HFN continuity by indicating PDCP SN and HFN of the first PDCP SDU that
the source gNB forwards to the target gNB. The subsequent messages may
be sent for discarding of already forwarded downlink PDCP SDUs in the
target gNB.</p>
<p>- The source gNB does not stop transmitting downlink packets to the
UE. The source gNB keeps forwarding to the 5GC the uplink SDAP SDUs
successfully received in-sequence from the UE.</p>
<p>Handling of end marker packets:</p>
<p>- The source NG-RAN node receives one or several GTP-U end marker
packets per PDU session from the UPF and replicates the end marker
packets into each data forwarding tunnel when no more user data packets
are to be forwarded over that tunnel.</p>
<p>- End marker packets sent via a data forwarding tunnel are applicable
to all QoS flows forwarded via that tunnel. After end marker packets
have been received over a forwarding tunnel, the target NG-RAN node can
start taking into account the packets of QoS flows associated with that
forwarding tunnel received at the target NG-RAN node from the NG-U PDU
session tunnel.</p>
<h4 id="re-establishment-procedure">9.2.3.3 Re-establishment
procedure</h4>
<p>A UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the re-establishment procedure to
continue the RRC connection when a failure condition occurs (e.g. radio
link failure, reconfiguration failure, integrity check failure…).</p>
<p>The following figure describes the re-establishment procedure started
by the UE:</p>
<p><img src="media/image45.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 9.2.3.3-1: Re-establishment procedure</p>
<p>1. The UE re-establishes the connection, providing the UE Identity
(PCI+C-RNTI) to the gNB where the trigger for the re-establishment
occurred.</p>
<p>2. If the UE Context is not locally available, the gNB, requests the
last serving gNB to provide UE Context data.</p>
<p>3. The last serving gNB provides UE context data.</p>
<p>4/4a. The gNB continues the re-establishment of the RRC connection.
The message is sent on SRB1.</p>
<p>5/5a. The gNB may perform the reconfiguration to re-establish SRB2
and DRBs when the re-establishment procedure is ongoing.</p>
<p>6/7. If loss of user data buffered in the last serving gNB shall be
prevented, the gNB provides forwarding addresses, and the last serving
gNB provides the SN status to the gNB.</p>
<p>8/9. The gNB performs path switch.</p>
<p>10. The gNB triggers the release of the UE resources at the last
serving gNB.</p>
<p>The IAB-MT in SA mode follows the same re-establishment procedure as
described for the UE. After the backhaul has been established, the
re-establishment procedure of the IAB-MT is part of the intra-CU
backhaul RLF recovery procedure for IAB-nodes defined in TS 38.401 [4].
Modifications to the configuration of BAP sublayer and higher protocol
layers above the BAP sublayer are described in TS 38.401 [4].</p>
<h4 id="conditional-handover">9.2.3.4 Conditional Handover</h4>
<h5 id="general-1">9.2.3.4.1 General</h5>
<p>A Conditional Handover (CHO) is defined as a handover that is
executed by the UE when one or more handover execution conditions are
met. The UE starts evaluating the execution condition(s) upon receiving
the CHO configuration, and stops evaluating the execution condition(s)
once a handover is executed.</p>
<p>The following principles apply to CHO:</p>
<p>- The CHO configuration contains the configuration of CHO candidate
cell(s) generated by the candidate gNB(s) and execution condition(s)
generated by the source gNB.</p>
<p>- An execution condition may consist of one or two trigger
condition(s) (CHO events A3/A5, as defined in [12]). Only single RS type
is supported and at most two different trigger quantities (e.g. RSRP and
RSRQ, RSRP and SINR, etc.) can be configured simultaneously for the
evalution of CHO execution condition of a single candidate cell.</p>
<p>- Before any CHO execution condition is satisfied, upon reception of
HO command (without CHO configuration), the UE executes the HO procedure
as described in clause 9.2.3.2, regardless of any previously received
CHO configuration.</p>
<p>- While executing CHO, i.e. from the time when the UE starts
synchronization with target cell, UE does not monitor source cell.</p>
<p>CHO is also supported for the IAB-MT in context of intra- and
inter-donor IAB-node migration and BH RLF recovery.</p>
<p>CHO is not supported for NG-C based handover in this release of the
specification.</p>
<h5 id="c-plane-handling-1">9.2.3.4.2 C-plane handling</h5>
<p>As in intra-NR RAN handover, in intra-NR RAN CHO, the preparation and
execution phase of the conditional handover procedure is performed
without involvement of the 5GC; i.e. preparation messages are directly
exchanged between gNBs. The release of the resources at the source gNB
during the conditional handover completion phase is triggered by the
target gNB. The figure below depicts the basic conditional handover
scenario where neither the AMF nor the UPF changes:</p>
<p><img src="media/image46.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 9.2.3.4.2-1: Intra-AMF/UPF Conditional Handover</p>
<p>0/1. Same as step 0, 1 in Figure 9.2.3.2.1-1 of clause 9.2.3.2.1.</p>
<p>2. The source gNB decides to use CHO.</p>
<p>3. The source gNB requests CHO for one or more candidate cells
belonging to one or more candidate gNBs. A CHO request message is sent
for each candidate cell.</p>
<p>4. Same as step 4 in Figure 9.2.3.2.1-1 of clause 9.2.3.2.1.</p>
<p>5. The candidate gNB(s) sends CHO response (HO REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE)
including configuration of CHO candidate cell(s) to the source gNB. The
CHO response message is sent for each candidate cell.</p>
<p>6. The source gNB sends an <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to the
UE, containing the configuration of CHO candidate cell(s) and CHO
execution condition(s).</p>
<p>NOTE 1: CHO configuration of candidate cells can be followed by other
reconfiguration from the source gNB.</p>
<p>NOTE 1a: A configuration of a CHO candidate cell cannot contain a
DAPS handover configuration.</p>
<p>7. The UE sends an <em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em> message to the
source gNB.</p>
<p>7a If early data forwarding is applied, the source gNB sends the
EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message.</p>
<p>8. The UE maintains connection with the source gNB after receiving
CHO configuration, and starts evaluating the CHO execution conditions
for the candidate cell(s). If at least one CHO candidate cell satisfies
the corresponding CHO execution condition, the UE detaches from the
source gNB, applies the stored corresponding configuration for that
selected candidate cell, synchronises to that candidate cell and
completes the RRC handover procedure by sending
<em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em> message to the target gNB. The UE
releases stored CHO configurations after successful completion of RRC
handover procedure.</p>
<p>8a/b The target gNB sends the HANDOVER SUCCESS message to the source
gNB to inform that the UE has successfully accessed the target cell. In
return, the source gNB sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message following
the principles described in step 7 of Intra-AMF/UPF Handover in clause
9.2.3.2.1.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: Late data forwarding may be initiated as soon as the source
gNB receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message.</p>
<p>8c. The source gNB sends the HANDOVER CANCEL message toward the other
signalling connections or other candidate target gNBs, if any, to cancel
CHO for the UE.</p>
<h5 id="u-plane-handling-1">9.2.3.4.3 U-plane handling</h5>
<p>The U-plane handling for Conditional Handover follows the same
principles for DAPS handover in 9.2.3.2.2, if early data forwarding is
applied, except that, in case of Full Configuration, HFN and PDCP SN are
reset in the target gNB after the SN assignment is handed over to the
target gNB. If late data forwarding is applied, the U-plane handling
follows the RLC-AM or RLC-UM bearer principles defined in 9.2.3.2.2.</p>
<h5 id="data-forwarding-1">9.2.3.4.4 Data Forwarding</h5>
<p>If late data forwarding is applied, the source NG-RAN node initiates
data forwarding once it knows which target NG-RAN node the UE has
successfully accessed. In that case the behavior of the Conditional
Handover data forwarding follows the same behavior as defined in
9.2.3.2.3 for the intra-system handover data forwarding, except the
behavior for DRBs configured with DAPS handover.</p>
<p>If early data forwarding is applied instead, the source NG-RAN node
initiates data forwarding before the UE executes the handover, to a
candidate target node of interest. The behavior of early data forwarding
for the Conditional Handover follows the same principles for DRBs
configured with DAPS handover in the intra-system handover as defined in
9.2.3.2.3.</p>
<h3 id="measurements">9.2.4 Measurements</h3>
<p>In RRC_CONNECTED, the UE measures multiple beams (at least one) of a
cell and the measurements results (power values) are averaged to derive
the cell quality. In doing so, the UE is configured to consider a subset
of the detected beams. Filtering takes place at two different levels: at
the physical layer to derive beam quality and then at RRC level to
derive cell quality from multiple beams. Cell quality from beam
measurements is derived in the same way for the serving cell(s) and for
the non-serving cell(s). Measurement reports may contain the measurement
results of the <em>X</em> best beams if the UE is configured to do so by
the gNB.</p>
<p>The corresponding high-level measurement model is described
below:</p>
<p><img src="media/image47.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 9.2.4-1: Measurement Model</p>
<p>NOTE 1: K beams correspond to the measurements on SSB or CSI-RS
resources configured for L3 mobility by gNB and detected by UE at
L1.</p>
<p>- <strong>A</strong>: measurements (beam specific samples) internal
to the physical layer.</p>
<p>- <strong>Layer 1 filtering</strong>: internal layer 1 filtering of
the inputs measured at point A. Exact filtering is implementation
dependent. How the measurements are actually executed in the physical
layer by an implementation (inputs A and Layer 1 filtering) is not
constrained by the standard.</p>
<p>- <strong>A<sup>1</sup></strong>: measurements (i.e. beam specific
measurements) reported by layer 1 to layer 3 after layer 1
filtering.</p>
<p><strong>- Beam Consolidation/Selection</strong>: beam specific
measurements are consolidated to derive cell quality. The behaviour of
the Beam consolidation/selection is standardised and the configuration
of this module is provided by RRC signalling. Reporting period at B
equals one measurement period at A<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p><strong>- B</strong>: a measurement (i.e. cell quality) derived from
beam-specific measurements reported to layer 3 after beam
consolidation/selection.</p>
<p>- <strong>Layer 3 filtering for cell quality</strong>: filtering
performed on the measurements provided at point B. The behaviour of the
Layer 3 filters is standardised and the configuration of the layer 3
filters is provided by RRC signalling. Filtering reporting period at C
equals one measurement period at B.</p>
<p>- <strong>C</strong>: a measurement after processing in the layer 3
filter. The reporting rate is identical to the reporting rate at point
B. This measurement is used as input for one or more evaluation of
reporting criteria.</p>
<p>- <strong>Evaluation of reporting criteria</strong>: checks whether
actual measurement reporting is necessary at point D. The evaluation can
be based on more than one flow of measurements at reference point C e.g.
to compare between different measurements. This is illustrated by input
C and C<sup>1</sup>. The UE shall evaluate the reporting criteria at
least every time a new measurement result is reported at point C,
C<sup>1</sup>. The reporting criteria are standardised and the
configuration is provided by RRC signalling (UE measurements).</p>
<p>- <strong>D</strong>: measurement report information (message) sent
on the radio interface.</p>
<p>- <strong>L3 Beam filtering</strong>: filtering performed on the
measurements (i.e. beam specific measurements) provided at point
A<sup>1</sup>. The behaviour of the beam filters is standardised and the
configuration of the beam filters is provided by RRC signalling.
Filtering reporting period at E equals one measurement period at
A<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>- <strong>E</strong>: a measurement (i.e. beam-specific measurement)
after processing in the beam filter. The reporting rate is identical to
the reporting rate at point A<sup>1</sup>. This measurement is used as
input for selecting the X measurements to be reported.</p>
<p>- <strong>Beam Selection for beam reporting</strong>: selects the X
measurements from the measurements provided at point E. The behaviour of
the beam selection is standardised and the configuration of this module
is provided by RRC signalling.</p>
<p>- <strong>F</strong>: beam measurement information included in
measurement report (sent) on the radio interface.</p>
<p>Layer 1 filtering introduces a certain level of measurement
averaging. How and when the UE exactly performs the required
measurements is implementation specific to the point that the output at
B fulfils the performance requirements set in TS 38.133 [13]. Layer 3
filtering for cell quality and related parameters used are specified in
TS 38.331 [12] and do not introduce any delay in the sample availability
between B and C. Measurement at point C, C<sup>1</sup> is the input used
in the event evaluation. L3 Beam filtering and related parameters used
are specified in TS 38.331 [12] and do not introduce any delay in the
sample availability between E and F.</p>
<p>Measurement reports are characterized by the following:</p>
<p>- Measurement reports include the measurement identity of the
associated measurement configuration that triggered the reporting;</p>
<p>- Cell and beam measurement quantities to be included in measurement
reports are configured by the network;</p>
<p>- The number of non-serving cells to be reported can be limited
through configuration by the network;</p>
<p>- Cells belonging to an exclude-list configured by the network are
not used in event evaluation and reporting, and conversely when an
allow-list is configured by the network, only the cells belonging to the
allow-list are used in event evaluation and reporting;</p>
<p>- Beam measurements to be included in measurement reports are
configured by the network (beam identifier only, measurement result and
beam identifier, or no beam reporting).</p>
<p>Intra-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements and inter-frequency
neighbour (cell) measurements are defined as follows:</p>
<p>- SSB based intra-frequency measurement: a measurement is defined as
an SSB based intra-frequency measurement provided the center frequency
of the SSB of the serving cell and the center frequency of the SSB of
the neighbour cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two
SSBs is also the same.</p>
<p>- SSB based inter-frequency measurement: a measurement is defined as
an SSB based inter-frequency measurement provided the center frequency
of the SSB of the serving cell and the center frequency of the SSB of
the neighbour cell are different, or the subcarrier spacing of the two
SSBs is different.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: For SSB based measurements, one measurement object
corresponds to one SSB and the UE considers different SSBs as different
cells.</p>
<p>NOTE 2a: If a RedCap UE is configured to perform serving cell
measurements based on an NCD-SSB configured in its active BWP, this
NCD-SSB is considered as the SSB of the serving cell in the definition
of intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements as above.</p>
<p>- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement: a measurement is defined
as a CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement provided that:</p>
<p>- The subcarrier spacing of CSI-RS resources on the neighbour cell
configured for measurement is the same as the SCS of CSI-RS resources on
the serving cell indicated for measurement; and</p>
<p>- For 60kHz subcarrier spacing, the CP type of CSI-RS resources on
the neighbour cell configured for measurement is the same as the CP type
of CSI-RS resources on the serving cell indicated for measurement;
and</p>
<p>- The centre frequency of CSI-RS resources on the neighbour cell
configured for measurement is the same as the centre frequency of CSI-RS
resource on the serving cell indicated for measurement.</p>
<p>- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement: a measurement is defined
as a CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement if it is not a CSI-RS
based intra-frequency measurement.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: Extended CP for CSI-RS based measurement is not supported in
this release.</p>
<p>Whether a measurement is non-gap-assisted or gap-assisted depends on
the capability of the UE, the active BWP of the UE and the current
operating frequency:</p>
<p>- For SSB based inter-frequency measurement, if the measurement gap
requirement information is reported by the UE, a measurement gap
configuration may be provided according to the information. Otherwise, a
measurement gap configuration is always provided in the following
cases:</p>
<p>- If the UE only supports per-UE measurement gaps;</p>
<p>- If the UE supports per-FR measurement gaps and any of the serving
cells are in the same frequency range of the measurement object.</p>
<p>- For SSB based intra-frequency measurement, if the measurement gap
requirement information is reported by the UE, a measurement gap
configuration may be provided according to the information. Otherwise, a
measurement gap configuration is always provided in the following
case:</p>
<p>- Other than the initial BWP, if any of the UE or RedCap UE
configured BWPs do not contain the frequency domain resources of the SSB
associated to the initial DL BWP, and for RedCap UE, are not configured
with NCD-SSB for serving cell measurement.</p>
<p>In non-gap-assisted scenarios, the UE shall be able to carry out such
measurements without measurement gaps. In gap-assisted scenarios, the UE
cannot be assumed to be able to carry out such measurements without
measurement gaps.</p>
<p>Network may request the UE to measure NR and/or E-UTRA carriers in
RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE via system information or via dedicated
measurement configuration in <em>RRCRelease</em>. If the UE was
configured to perform measurements of NR and/or E-UTRA carriers while in
RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE, it may provide an indication of the
availability of corresponding measurement results to the gNB in the
<em>RRCSetupComplete</em> message. The network may request the UE to
report those measurements after security activation. The request for the
measurements can be sent by the network immediately after transmitting
the Security Mode Command (i.e. before the reception of the Security
Mode Complete from the UE).</p>
<p>If the UE was configured to perform measurements of NR and/or E-UTRA
carriers while in RRC_INACTIVE, the gNB can request the UE to provide
corresponding measurement results in the <em>RRCResume</em> message and
then the UE can include the available measurement results in the
<em>RRCResumeComplete</em> message. Alternatively, the UE may provide an
indication of the availability of the measurement results to the gNB in
the <em>RRCResumeComplete</em> message and the gNB can then request the
UE to provide these measurement results.</p>
<h3 id="paging">9.2.5 Paging</h3>
<p>Paging allows the network to reach UEs in RRC_IDLE and in
RRC_INACTIVE state through <em>Paging</em> messages, and to notify UEs
in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED state of system information
change (see clause 7.3.3) and ETWS/CMAS indications (see clause 16.4)
through <em>Short Messages</em>. Both <em>Paging</em> messages and
<em>Short Messages</em> are addressed with P-RNTI on PDCCH, but while
the former is sent on PCCH, the latter is sent over PDCCH directly (see
clause 6.5 of TS 38.331 [12]).</p>
<p>While in RRC_IDLE the UE monitors the paging channels for
CN-initiated paging. While in RRC_INACTIVE with no ongoing SDT procedure
(see clause 18.0) the UE monitors paging channels for RAN-initiated
paging and CN-initiated paging. A UE need not monitor paging channels
continuously though; Paging DRX is defined where the UE in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE is only required to monitor paging channels during one
Paging Occasion (PO) per DRX cycle (see TS 38.304 [10]). The Paging DRX
cycles are configured by the network:</p>
<p>1) For CN-initiated paging, a default cycle is broadcast in system
information;</p>
<p>2) For CN-initiated paging, a UE specific cycle can be configured via
NAS signalling;</p>
<p>3) For RAN-initiated paging, a UE-specific cycle is configured via
RRC signalling;</p>
<p>- The UE uses the shortest of the DRX cycles applicable i.e. a UE in
RRC_IDLE uses the shortest of the first two cycles above, while a UE in
RRC_INACTIVE uses the shortest of the three.</p>
<p>The POs of a UE for CN-initiated and RAN-initiated paging are based
on the same UE ID, resulting in overlapping POs for both. The number of
different POs in a DRX cycle is configurable via system information and
a network may distribute UEs to those POs based on their IDs.</p>
<p>While in RRC_CONNECTED and while in RRC_INACTIVE with ongoing SDT
procedure, the UE monitors the paging channels in any PO signalled in
system information for SI change indication and PWS notification. In
case of BA, a UE in RRC_CONNECTED only monitors paging channels on the
active BWP with common search space configured.</p>
<p>For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE can be
configured for an additional number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in its
PO to monitor for paging. However, when the UE detects a PDCCH
transmission within the UE's PO addressed with P-RNTI, the UE is not
required to monitor the subsequent PDCCH monitoring occasions within
this PO.</p>
<p>If Paging Cause is included in the Paging message, a UE in RRC_IDLE
or RRC_INACTIVE state may use the Paging Cause as per TS 23.501[3].</p>
<p><strong>Paging optimization for UEs in CM_IDLE</strong>: at UE
context release, the NG-RAN node may provide the AMF with a list of
recommended cells and NG-RAN nodes as assistance info for subsequent
paging. The AMF may also provide Paging Attempt Information consisting
of a Paging Attempt Count and the Intended Number of Paging Attempts and
may include the Next Paging Area Scope. If Paging Attempt Information is
included in the Paging message, each paged NG-RAN node receives the same
information during a paging attempt. The Paging Attempt Count shall be
increased by one at each new paging attempt. The Next Paging Area Scope,
when present, indicates whether the AMF plans to modify the paging area
currently selected at next paging attempt. If the UE has changed its
state to CM CONNECTED the Paging Attempt Count is reset.</p>
<p><strong>Paging optimization for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE</strong>: at RAN
Paging, the serving NG-RAN node provides RAN Paging area information.
The serving NG-RAN node may also provide RAN Paging attempt information.
Each paged NG-RAN node receives the same RAN Paging attempt information
during a paging attempt with the following content: Paging Attempt
Count, the intended number of paging attempts and the Next Paging Area
Scope. The Paging Attempt Count shall be increased by one at each new
paging attempt. The Next Paging Area Scope, when present, indicates
whether the serving NG_RAN node plans to modify the RAN Paging Area
currently selected at next paging attempt. If the UE leaves RRC_INACTIVE
state the Paging Attempt Count is reset.</p>
<p><strong>UE power saving for paging monitoring:</strong> in order to
reduce UE power consumption due to false paging alarms, the group of UEs
monitoring the same PO can be further divided into multiple subgroups.
With subgrouping, a UE shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for paging if the
subgroup to which the UE belongs is paged as indicated via associated
PEI. If a UE cannot find its subgroup ID with the PEI configurations in
a cell or if the UE is unable to monitor the associated PEI occasion
corresponding to its PO, it shall monitor the paging in its PO.</p>
<p>These subgroups have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>- They are formed based on either CN controlled subgrouping or UE ID
based subgrouping;</p>
<p>- If CN controlled subgroup ID is not provided from AMF, UE ID based
subgrouping is used if supported by the UE and network;</p>
<p>- The RRC state (RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state) does not impact
which subgroup the UE belongs to;</p>
<p>- Subgrouping support for a cell is broadcast in the system
information as one of the following: Only CN controlled subgrouping
supported, only UE ID based subgrouping supported, or both CN controlled
subgrouping and UE ID based subgrouping supported;</p>
<p>- Total number of subgroups allowed in a cell is up to 8 and
represents the sum of CN controlled and UE ID based subgrouping
configured by the network;</p>
<p>- A UE configured with CN controlled subgroup ID applies CN
controlled subgroup ID if the cell supports CN controlled subgrouping;
otherwise, it derives UE ID based subgroup ID if the cell supports only
UE ID based subgrouping.</p>
<p>PEI associated with subgroups has the following characteristics:</p>
<p>- If the PEI is supported by the UE, it shall at least support UE ID
based subgrouping method;</p>
<p>- PEI monitoring can be limited via system information to the last
used cell (i.e., the cell in which the UE most recently received
<em>RRCRelease</em> without indicating that the last used cell for PEI
shall not be updated);</p>
<p>- A PEI-capable UE shall store its last used cell information;</p>
<p>- gNBs supporting the PEI monitoring to the last used cell function
provide the UE's last used cell information to the AMF in the NG-AP UE
Context Release Complete message for PEI capable UEs, as described in TS
38.413 [26];</p>
<p>- UE that expects MBS group notification shall ignore the PEI and
shall monitor paging in its PO.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>CN controlled subgrouping:</strong> For CN controlled
subgrouping, AMF is responsible for assigning subgroup ID to the UE. The
total number of subgroups for CN controlled subgrouping which can be
configured, e.g. by OAM is up to 8. It is assumed that CN controlled
subgrouping support is homogeneous within an RNA.</p>
<p>The following figure describes the procedure for CN controlled
subgrouping:</p>

<p>1. The UE indicates its support of CN controlled subgrouping via NAS
signalling.</p>
<p>2. If the UE supports CN controlled subgrouping, the AMF determines
the subgroup ID assignment for the UE.</p>

<h3 id="random-access-procedure">9.2.6 Random Access Procedure</h3>
<p>The random access procedure is triggered by a number of events:</p>
<p>- Initial access from RRC_IDLE;</p>
<p>- RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure;</p>
<p>- DL or UL data arrival, during RRC_CONNECTED or during RRC_INACTIVE
while SDT procedure (see clause 18.0) is ongoing, when UL
synchronisation status is "non-synchronised";</p>
<p>- UL data arrival, during RRC_CONNECTED or during RRC_INACTIVE while
SDT procedure is ongoing, when there are no PUCCH resources for SR
available;</p>
<p>- Handover;</p>
<p>- SR failure;</p>
<p>- Explicit request by RRC upon synchronous reconfiguration;</p>
<p>- RRC Connection Resume procedure from RRC_INACTIVE;</p>
<p>- To establish time alignment for a secondary TAG;</p>
<p>- Request for Other SI (see clause 7.3);</p>
<p>- Beam failure recovery;</p>
<p>- Consistent UL LBT failure on SpCell;</p>
<p>- SDT in RRC_INACTIVE (see clause 18);</p>
<p>- Positioning purpose during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access
procedure, e.g., when timing advance is needed for UE positioning.</p>
<p>Two types of random access procedure are supported: 4-step RA type
with MSG1 and 2-step RA type with MSGA. Both types of RA procedure
support contention-based random access (CBRA) and contention-free random
access (CFRA) as shown on Figure 9.2.6-1 below.</p>
<p>The UE selects the type of random access at initiation of the random
access procedure based on network configuration:</p>
<p>- when CFRA resources are not configured, an RSRP threshold is used
by the UE to select between 2-step RA type and 4-step RA type;</p>
<p>- when CFRA resources for 4-step RA type are configured, UE performs
random access with 4-step RA type;</p>
<p>- when CFRA resources for 2-step RA type are configured, UE performs
random access with 2-step RA type.</p>
<p>The network does not configure CFRA resources for 4-step and 2-step
RA types at the same time for a Bandwidth Part (BWP). CFRA with 2-step
RA type is only supported for handover.</p>
<p>The MSG1 of the 4-step RA type consists of a preamble on PRACH. After
MSG1 transmission, the UE monitors for a response from the network
within a configured window. For CFRA, dedicated preamble for MSG1
transmission is assigned by the network and upon receiving random access
response from the network, the UE ends the random access procedure as
shown in Figure 9.2.6-1(c). For CBRA, upon reception of the random
access response, the UE sends MSG3 using the UL grant scheduled in the
response and monitors contention resolution as shown in Figure
9.2.6-1(a). If contention resolution is not successful after MSG3
(re)transmission(s), the UE goes back to MSG1 transmission.</p>
<p>The MSGA of the 2-step RA type includes a preamble on PRACH and a
payload on PUSCH. After MSGA transmission, the UE monitors for a
response from the network within a configured window. For CFRA,
dedicated preamble and PUSCH resource are configured for MSGA
transmission and upon receiving the network response, the UE ends the
random access procedure as shown in Figure 9.2.6-1(d). For CBRA, if
contention resolution is successful upon receiving the network response,
the UE ends the random access procedure as shown in Figure 9.2.6-1(b);
while if fallback indication is received in MSGB, the UE performs MSG3
transmission using the UL grant scheduled in the fallback indication and
monitors contention resolution as shown in Figure 9.2.6-2. If contention
resolution is not successful after MSG3 (re)transmission(s), the UE goes
back to MSGA transmission.</p>
<p>If the random access procedure with 2-step RA type is not completed
after a number of MSGA transmissions, the UE can be configured to switch
to CBRA with 4-step RA type.</p>

<p>Figure 9.2.6-2: Fallback for CBRA with 2-step RA type</p>
<p>For random access in a cell configured with SUL, the network can
explicitly signal which carrier to use (UL or SUL). Otherwise, the UE
selects the SUL carrier if and only if the measured quality of the DL is
lower than a broadcast threshold. UE performs carrier selection before
selecting between 2-step and 4-step RA type. The RSRP threshold for
selecting between 2-step and 4-step RA type can be configured separately
for UL and SUL. Once started, all uplink transmissions of the random
access procedure remain on the selected carrier.</p>
<p>The network can associate a set of RACH resources with feature(s)
applicable to a Random Access procedure: Network Slicing (see clause
16.3), RedCap (see clause 16.13), SDT (see clause 18), and NR coverage
enhancement (see clause 19). A set of RACH resources associated with a
feature is only valid for random access procedures applicable to at
least that feature; and a set of RACH resources associated with several
features is only valid for random access procedures having at least all
of these features. The UE selects the set(s) of applicable RACH
resources, after uplink carrier (i.e. NUL or SUL) and BWP selection and
before selecting the RA type.</p>
<p>When CA is configured, random access procedure with 2-step RA type is
only performed on PCell while contention resolution can be
cross-scheduled by the PCell.</p>
<p>When CA is configured, for random access procedure with 4-step RA
type, the first three steps of CBRA always occur on the PCell while
contention resolution (step 4) can be cross-scheduled by the PCell. The
three steps of a CFRA started on the PCell remain on the PCell. CFRA on
SCell can only be initiated by the gNB to establish timing advance for a
secondary TAG: the procedure is initiated by the gNB with a PDCCH order
(step 0) that is sent on an activated SCell of the secondary TAG,
preamble transmission (step 1) takes place on the SCell, and Random
Access Response (step 2) takes place on PCell.</p>
<h3 id="radio-link-failure">9.2.7 Radio Link Failure</h3>
<p>In RRC_CONNECTED, the UE performs Radio Link Monitoring (RLM) in the
active BWP based on reference signals (SSB/CSI-RS) and signal quality
thresholds configured by the network. SSB-based RLM is based on the SSB
associated to the initial DL BWP and can be configured for the initial
DL BWP and for DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL
BWP. Besides, SSB-based RLM can be also performed based on the non-cell
defining SSB, if configured for RedCap UEs. For other DL BWPs, RLM can
only be performed based on CSI-RS. In case of DAPS handover, the UE
continues the detection of radio link failure at the source cell until
the successful completion of the random access procedure to the target
cell.</p>
<p>The UE declares Radio Link Failure (RLF) when one of the following
criteria are met:</p>
<p>- Expiry of a radio problem timer started after indication of radio
problems from the physical layer (if radio problems are recovered before
the timer is expired, the UE stops the timer); or</p>
<p>- Expiry of a timer started upon triggering a measurement report for
a measurement identity for which the timer has been configured while
another radio problem timer is running; or</p>
<p>- Random access procedure failure; or</p>
<p>- RLC failure; or</p>
<p>- Detection of consistent uplink LBT failures for operation with
shared spectrum channel access as described in 5.6.1; or</p>
<p>- For IAB-MT, the reception of a BH RLF indication received from its
parent node.</p>
<p>After RLF is declared, the UE:</p>
<p>- stays in RRC_CONNECTED;</p>
<p>- in case of DAPS handover, for RLF in the source cell:</p>
<p>- stops any data transmission or reception via the source link and
releases the source link, but maintains the source RRC
configuration;</p>
<p>- if handover failure is then declared at the target cell, the
UE:</p>
<p>- selects a suitable cell and then initiates RRC
re-establishment;</p>
<p>- enters RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell was not found within a certain
time after handover failure was declared.</p>
<p>- in case of CHO, for RLF in the source cell:</p>
<p>- selects a suitable cell and if the selected cell is a CHO candidate
and if network configured the UE to try CHO after RLF then the UE
attempts CHO execution once, otherwise re-establishment is
performed;</p>
<p>- enters RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell was not found within a certain
time after RLF was declared.</p>
<p>- otherwise, for RLF in the serving cell or in case of DAPS handover,
for RLF in the target cell before releasing the source cell:</p>
<p>- selects a suitable cell and then initiates RRC
re-establishment;</p>
<p>- enters RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell was not found within a certain
time after RLF was declared.</p>
<p>When RLF occurs at the IAB BH link, the same mechanisms and
procedures are applied as for the access link. This includes BH RLF
detection and RLF recovery.</p>
<p>The IAB-DU can transmit a BH RLF detection indication to its child
nodes in the following cases:</p>
<p>- The collocated IAB-MT initiates RRC re-establishment;</p>
<p>- The collocated IAB-MT is dual-connected, detects BH RLF on a BH
link, and cannot perform UL re-routing for any traffic. This includes
the scenario of an IAB-node operating in EN-DC or NR-DC, which uses only
one link for backhauling and has BH RLF on this BH link;</p>
<p>- The collocated IAB-MT has received a BH RLF detection indication
from a parent node, and there is no remaining backhaul link that is
unaffected by the BH RLF condition indicated.</p>
<p>Upon reception of the BH RLF detection indication, the child node may
perform local rerouting for upstream traffic, if possible, over an
available BH link.</p>
<p>If the IAB-DU has transmitted a BH RLF detection indication to a
child node due to an RLF condition on the collocated IAB-MT's parent
link, and the collocated IAB-MT's subsequent RLF recovery is successful,
the IAB-DU may transmit a BH RLF recovery indication to this child
node.</p>
<p>If the IAB-DU has transmitted a BH RLF detection indication to a
child node due to the reception of a BH RLF detection indication by the
collocated IAB-MT, and the collocated IAB-MT receives a BH RLF recovery
indication, the IAB-DU may also transmit a BH RLF recovery indication to
this child node.</p>
<p>Upon reception of the BH RLF recovery indication, the child node
reverts the actions triggered by the reception of the previous BH RLF
detection indication.</p>
<p>In case the RRC re-establishment procedure fails, the IAB-node may
transmit a BH RLF indication to its child nodes. The BH RLF detection
indication, BH RLF recovery indication and BH RLF indication are
transmitted as BAP Control PDUs.</p>
<h3 id="beam-failure-detection-and-recovery">9.2.8 Beam failure
detection and recovery</h3>
<p>For beam failure detection, the gNB configures the UE with beam
failure detection reference signals (SSB or CSI-RS) and the UE declares
beam failure when the number of beam failure instance indications from
the physical layer reaches a configured threshold before a configured
timer expires. For beam failure detection in multi-TRP operation, the
gNB configures the UE with two sets of beam failure detection reference
signals, and the UE declares beam failure for a TRP / BFD-RS set when
the number of beam failure instance indications associated with the
corresponding set of beam failure detection reference signals from the
physical layer reaches a configured threshold before a configured timer
expires.</p>
<p>SSB-based Beam Failure Detection is based on the SSB associated to
the initial DL BWP and can be configured for the initial DL BWPs and for
DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. Besides,
SSB-based Beam Failure Detection can be also performed based on the
non-cell defining SSB, if configured for RedCap UEs. For other DL BWPs,
Beam Failure Detection can only be performed based on CSI-RS.</p>
<p>After beam failure is detected on PCell, the UE:</p>
<p>- triggers beam failure recovery by initiating a Random Access
procedure on the PCell;</p>
<p>- selects a suitable beam to perform beam failure recovery (if the
gNB has provided dedicated Random Access resources for certain beams,
those will be prioritized by the UE).</p>
<p>- includes an indication of a beam failure on PCell in a BFR MAC CE
if the Random Access procedure involves contention-based random
access.</p>
<p>Upon completion of the Random Access procedure, beam failure recovery
for PCell is considered complete.</p>
<p>After beam failure is detected on an SCell, the UE:</p>
<p>- triggers beam failure recovery by initiating a transmission of a
BFR MAC CE for this SCell;</p>
<p>- selects a suitable beam for this SCell (if available) and indicates
it along with the information about the beam failure in the BFR MAC
CE.</p>
<p>Upon reception of a PDCCH indicating an uplink grant for a new
transmission for the HARQ process used for the transmission of the BFR
MAC CE, beam failure recovery for this SCell is considered complete.</p>
<p>After beam failure is detected for a BFD-RS set of a Serving Cell,
the UE:</p>
<p>- triggers beam failure recovery by initiating a transmission of a
BFR MAC CE for this BFD-RS set;</p>
<p>- selects a suitable beam for this BFD-RS set (if available) and
indicates whether the suitable (new) beam is found or not along with the
information about the beam failure in the BFR MAC CE for this BFD-RS
set.</p>
<p>Upon reception of a PDCCH indicating an uplink grant for a new
transmission for the HARQ process used for the transmission of the BFR
MAC CE for this BFD-RS set, beam failure recovery for this BFD-RS set is
considered complete.</p>
<p>After beam failure is detected for both BFD-RS sets of PCell
concurrently, the UE:</p>
<p>- triggers beam failure recovery by initiating a Random Access
procedure on the PCell;</p>
<p>- selects a suitable beam for each failed BFD-RS set (if available)
and indicates whether the suitable (new) beam is found or not along with
the information about the beam failure in the BFR MAC CE for each failed
BFD-RS set;</p>
<p>- upon completion of the Random Access procedure, beam failure
recovery for both BFD-RS sets of PCell is considered complete.</p>
<h3 id="timing-advance">9.2.9 Timing Advance</h3>
<p>In RRC_CONNECTED, the gNB is responsible for maintaining the timing
advance to keep the L1 synchronised. Serving cells having UL to which
the same timing advance applies and using the same timing reference cell
are grouped in a TAG. Each TAG contains at least one serving cell with
configured uplink, and the mapping of each serving cell to a TAG is
configured by RRC.</p>
<p>For the primary TAG the UE uses the PCell as timing reference, except
with shared spectrum channel access where an SCell can also be used in
certain cases (see clause 7.1, TS 38.133 [13]). In a secondary TAG, the
UE may use any of the activated SCells of this TAG as a timing reference
cell, but should not change it unless necessary.</p>
<p>Timing advance updates are signalled by the gNB to the UE via MAC CE
commands. Such commands restart a TAG-specific timer which indicates
whether the L1 can be synchronised or not: when the timer is running,
the L1 is considered synchronised, otherwise, the L1 is considered
non-synchronised (in which case uplink transmission can only take place
through MSG1/MSGA).</p>
<h3 id="extended-drx-for-rrc_idle-and-rrc_inactive">9.2.10 Extended DRX
for RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE</h3>
<p>When extended DRX (eDRX) is used, the following applies:</p>
<p>- For RRC_INACTIVE, eDRX configuration for RAN paging is decided and
configured by NG-RAN. In RRC_INACTIVE the UE monitors both RAN and CN
paging;</p>
<p>- For RRC_IDLE, eDRX for CN paging is configured by upper layers. In
RRC_IDLE the UE monitors only CN paging;</p>
<p>- Information on whether eDRX for CN paging and RAN paging is allowed
on the cell is provided separately in system information;</p>
<p>- The maximum value of the eDRX cycle is 10485.76 seconds (2.91
hours) for RRC_IDLE and 10.24 seconds for RRC_INACTIVE, while the
minimum value of the eDRX cycle is 2.56 seconds for both RRC_IDLE and
RRC_INACTIVE;</p>
<p>- The hyper SFN (H-SFN) is broadcast by the cell and increments by
one when the SFN wraps around;</p>
<p>- Paging Hyperframe (PH) refers to the H-SFN in which the UE starts
monitoring paging according to DRX during a Paging Time Window (PTW)
used in RRC_IDLE. The PH and PTW are determined based on a formula (see
TS 38.304 [10]) that is known by the AMF, UE and NG-RAN;</p>
<p>- H-SFN, PH and PTW are used if the eDRX cycle is greater than 10.24
seconds;</p>
<p>- When the RRC_IDLE eDRX cycle is longer than the system information
modification period, the UE verifies that stored system information
remains valid before resuming/establishing an RRC connection.</p>

<p>- The in-sequence and lossless handover is supported for the handover
between gNB and ng-eNB.</p>
<p>- Both Xn and NG based inter-RAT handover between NG-RAN nodes is

<p>- Only forwarding of downlink data is supported.</p>
<p>- PDU session information at the serving NG-RAN node contains mapping
information per QoS Flow to a corresponding E-RAB.</p>
<p>- At handover preparation, the source NG-RAN node shall decide which
mapped E-RABs are proposed to be subject to data forwarding and provide
this information in the source-to-target container to the target eNB.
Based on availability of direct data forwarding path the source NG-RAN
node may request to apply direct data forwarding by indicating direct
data forwarding path availability to the 5GC.</p>
<p>- The target eNB assigns forwarding TEID/TNL address(es) for the
E-RAB(s) for which it accepts data forwarding.</p>
<p>- In case of indirect data forwarding, a single data forwarding
tunnel is established between the source NG-RAN node and UPF per PDU
session for which at least data for a single QoS Flow is subject to data

<p>In case of indirect data forwarding, user plane handling for
inter-System data forwarding from 5GS to EPS follows the following key
principles:</p>
<p>- For the QoS flows accepted for data forwarding, the NG-RAN node
initiates data forwarding to the UPF by the corresponding PDU session
data forwarding tunnel(s).</p>
<p>- The UPF maps forwarded data received from the per PDU session data
forwarding tunnel(s) to the mapped EPS bearer(s) removing the QFI.</p>
<p>- Handling of end marker packets:</p>
<p>- The source NG-RAN node receives one or several end marker packets
per PDU session from the UPF. When there are no more data packets to be
forwarded for QoS flows mapped to an E-RAB, the source NG-RAN node sends
one or several end markers including one QFI (by means of the PDU
Session User Plane protocol TS 38.415 [30]) of those QoS flows mapped to
that E-RAB and sends the end marker packets to the UPF over the PDU
session tunnel. From the included QFI in the end markers and its mapping
to an EPS bearer ID, the UPF knows which EPS bearer tunnel it needs to
forward the end-markers to the SGW. The QFI is removed in the end marker
packets sent to the SGW.</p>
<p>In case of direct data forwarding, user plane handling for
inter-System data forwarding from 5GS to EPS follows the following key
principles:</p>
<p>- For the QoS flows accepted for data forwarding, the source NG-RAN
node maps data received from the NG-U PDU session tunnel to the
respective E-RAB data forwarding tunnel and forwards each user packet as
PDCP SDU without PDCP SN and QFI information.</p>
<p>- The source NG-RAN node receives one or several GTP-U end marker
packets per PDU session from the UPF and replicates the end marker
packets into each E-RAB data forwarding tunnel when no more user data
packets are to be forwarded over that tunnel.</p>

<p>- Only forwarding of downlink data is supported.</p>
<p>- The target NG-RAN node receives in the Handover Request message the
mapping between E-RAB ID(s) and QoS Flow ID(s). It decides whether to
accept the data forwarding for E-RAB IDs proposed for forwarding within

<p>- In case of direct data forwarding:</p>
<p>- The source eNB indicates direct path availability to the CN. The
source eNB's decision is indicated by the CN to the target NG-RAN
node.</p>
<p>- The target NG-RAN node assigns a TEID/TNL address for each E-RAB it
accepted for data forwarding.</p>
<p>- The source eNB receives in the Handover Command message the list of
E-RAB IDs for which the target NG-RAN node has accepted data
forwarding.</p>
<h4 id="data-forwarding-for-the-user-plane-1">9.3.3.2 Data Forwarding
for the User Plane</h4>
<p>In case of indirect data forwarding, user plane handling for
inter-System data forwarding from EPS to 5GS follows the following key
principles:</p>
<p>- For each E-RAB accepted for data forwarding, the source eNB
forwards data to the SGW in the corresponding E-RAB tunnel and the SGW
forwards the received data to the UPF in the E-RAB tunnel.</p>
<p>- The UPF maps the forwarded data received from an E-RAB tunnel to
the corresponding mapped PDU session tunnel, adding a QFI value (by
means of the PDU Session User Plane protocol TS 38.415 [30]).</p>
<p>- The target NG-RAN node maps a forwarded packet to the corresponding
DRB based on the received QFI value. It prioritizes the forwarded
packets over the fresh packets for those QoS flows.</p>
<p>- Handling of end marker packets:</p>
<p>- The UPF/PGW-U sends one or several end marker packets to the SGW
per EPS bearer. The SGW forwards the received end markers per EPS bearer
to the source eNB. When there are no more data packets to be forwarded
for an E-RAB, the source eNB forwards the received end markers in the
EPS bearer tunnel to the SGW and the SGW forwards them to the UPF. The
UPF adds one QFI (by means of the PDU Session User Plane protocol TS
38.415 [30]) among the QoS flows mapped to that E-RAB to the end markers
and sends those end markers to the target NG-RAN node in the per PDU
session tunnel. When the target NG-RAN node receives an end marker with
a QFI added, the target NG-RAN node starts to transmit the data packets
of all QoS flows mapped to the corresponding E-RAB received from the
core network towards the UE.</p>
<p>In case of direct data forwarding, user plane handling for
inter-System data forwarding from EPS to 5GS follows the following key
principles:</p>
<p>- For each E-RAB accepted for data forwarding, the source node
forwards data to the target NG-RAN node in the corresponding E-RAB data
forwarding tunnel.</p>
<p>- Until a GTP-U end marker packet is received, the target NG-RAN node
prioritizes the forwarded packets over the fresh packets for those QoS
flows which are involved in the accepted data forwarding.</p>
<p>NOTE: The target NG-RAN node should remove the forwarded PDCP SNs if
received in the forwarded GTP-U packets, and deliver the forwarded PDCP
SDUs to the UE.</p>

<h4 id="handover-with-srvcc-operation">9.3.4.1 Handover with SRVCC
operation</h4>
<p>The source NR node decides to handover the UE with ongoing IMS voice
from NR to UTRAN according the following principles:</p>
<p>- The source NR node determines that the UE supports UTRA and
requests the UE to send its UTRA radio access capabilities to the
NG-RAN;</p>
<p>- The source NR node configures target RAT measurement and
reporting;</p>
<p>- The source NR node determines based on the radio conditions and the
indication that SRVCC operation is possible that handover to UTRAN
should be initiated;</p>
<p>- The source NR node initiates the handover preparation only for the
ongoing IMS voice and provides the indication to AMF that the handover
is towards UTRAN together with the target UTRAN Node ID. The source NR
node also provides an indication to the target UTRAN that the incoming
handover originates from 5G. The SRVCC proceeds as specified in TS
23.216 [34];</p>
<p>- The source NR node ensures that the size of the source-to-target
container does not exceed the limits that can be handled by the
interfaces involved in the handover;</p>
<p>NOTE: For SRVCC handover, the size limit of the inter-node
source-to-target container is 2560 octets (see AN-APDU in TS 29.002
[44]).</p>
<p>- Radio resources are prepared in the target RAT before the
handover;</p>
<p>- The RRC reconfiguration message from the target RAT is delivered to
the source NR node via a transparent container and is passed to the UE
by the source NR node in the handover command;</p>
<p>- In-sequence and lossless handovers are not supported;</p>
<p>- Only voice bearer is handed over to target RAT;</p>
<p>- Security procedures for handover to UTRA follows the procedures as

<p>- Only handover to UTRA-FDD is supported.</p>
<h4 id="measurements-3">9.3.4.2 Measurements</h4>
<p>Inter RAT measurements are performed for UTRA.</p>
<h2 id="roaming-and-access-restrictions">9.4 Roaming and Access
Restrictions</h2>
<p>The roaming and access restriction information for a UE includes
information on restrictions to be applied for subsequent mobility action
during CM-CONNECTED state. It may be provided by the AMF and also may be
updated by the AMF later.</p>
<p>It includes the forbidden RAT, the forbidden area and the service
area restrictions as specified in TS 23.501 [3]. It also includes
serving PLMN/SNPN and may include a list of equivalent PLMNs. It may
also include PNI-NPN mobility restrictions (i.e. list of CAGs allowed
for the UE and whether the UE can also access non-CAG cells). The gNB
shall consider that roaming or access to CAG cells is only allowed if
PNI-NPN mobility information is available for the UE.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the roaming and access restriction information for a
UE, if applicable, the gNB should use it to determine whether to apply
restriction handling for subsequent mobility action, e.g., handover,
redirection.</p>
<p>If the roaming and access restriction information is not available
for a UE at the gNB, the gNB shall consider that there is no restriction
for subsequent mobility actions except for the PNI-NPN mobility as
described in TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<p>Only if received over NG or Xn signalling, the roaming and access
restriction information shall be propagated over Xn by the source gNB
during Xn handover. If the Xn handover results in a change of serving
PLMN (to an equivalent PLMN), the source gNB shall replace the serving
PLMN with the identity of the target PLMN and move the serving PLMN to
the equivalent PLMN list, before propagating the roaming and access
restriction information.</p>
<p>If NG-RAN nodes with different versions of the XnAP or NGAP protocol
are deployed, information provided by the 5GC within the NGAP Mobility
Restriction List may be lost in the course of Xn mobility. In order to
avoid such loss of information at Xn handover or UE context retrieval
due to a source NG-RAN node or an old NG-RAN node not able to recognise
the entire content, the source NG-RAN node or the old NG-RAN node may
provide an 5GC Mobility Restriction List Container to the target NG-RAN
node or the new NG-RAN node, containing the Mobility Restriction List as
received from the 5GC. The target NG-RAN node or the new NG-RAN node
shall use the information contained in the 5GC Mobility Restriction List
Container as the Mobility Restriction List, except for the Serving PLMN
and the Equivalent PLMNs, which the NG-RAN node shall use from the XnAP
Mobility Restriction List. The 5GC Mobility Restriction List Container
may be propagated at future Xn handover and UE context retrieval.</p>
<h1 id="scheduling-1">10 Scheduling</h1>
<h2 id="basic-scheduler-operation">10.1 Basic Scheduler Operation</h2>
<p>In order to utilise radio resources efficiently, MAC in gNB includes
dynamic resource schedulers that allocate physical layer resources for
the downlink and the uplink. In this clause, an overview of the
scheduler is given in terms of scheduler operation, signalling of
scheduler decisions, and measurements.</p>
<p>Scheduler Operation:</p>
<p>- Taking into account the UE buffer status and the QoS requirements
of each UE and associated radio bearers, schedulers assign resources
between UEs;</p>
<p>- Schedulers may assign resources taking account the radio conditions
at the UE identified through measurements made at the gNB and/or
reported by the UE;</p>
<p>- Resource assignment consists of radio resources (resource
blocks).</p>
<p>Signalling of Scheduler Decisions:</p>
<p>- UEs identify the resources by receiving a scheduling (resource
assignment) channel.</p>
<p>Measurements to Support Scheduler Operation:</p>
<p>- Uplink buffer status reports (measuring the data that is buffered
in the logical channel queues in the UE) are used to provide support for
QoS-aware packet scheduling;</p>
<p>- Power headroom reports (measuring the difference between the
nominal UE maximum transmit power and the estimated power for uplink
transmission) are used to provide support for power aware packet
scheduling.</p>
<h2 id="downlink-scheduling">10.2 Downlink Scheduling</h2>
<p>In the downlink, the gNB can dynamically allocate resources to UEs
via the C-RNTI on PDCCH(s). A UE always monitors the PDCCH(s) in order
to find possible assignments when its downlink reception is enabled
(activity governed by DRX when configured). When CA is configured, the
same C-RNTI applies to all serving cells.</p>
<p>The gNB may pre-empt an ongoing PDSCH transmission to one UE with a
latency-critical transmission to another UE. The gNB can configure UEs
to monitor interrupted transmission indications using INT-RNTI on a
PDCCH. If a UE receives the interrupted transmission indication, the UE
may assume that no useful information to that UE was carried by the
resource elements included in the indication, even if some of those
resource elements were already scheduled to this UE.</p>
<p>In addition, with Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS), the gNB can
allocate downlink resources for the initial HARQ transmissions to UEs:
RRC defines the periodicity of the configured downlink assignments while
PDCCH addressed to CS-RNTI can either signal and activate the configured
downlink assignment, or deactivate it; i.e. a PDCCH addressed to CS-RNTI
indicates that the downlink assignment can be implicitly reused
according to the periodicity defined by RRC, until deactivated.</p>
<p>NOTE: When required, retransmissions are explicitly scheduled on
PDCCH(s).</p>
<p>The dynamically allocated downlink reception overrides the configured
downlink assignment in the same serving cell, if they overlap in time.
Otherwise a downlink reception according to the configured downlink
assignment is assumed, if activated.</p>
<p>The UE may be configured with up to 8 active configured downlink
assignments for a given BWP of a serving cell. When more than one is
configured:</p>
<p>- The network decides which of these configured downlink assignments
are active at a time (including all of them); and</p>
<p>- Each configured downlink assignment is activated separately using a
DCI command and deactivation of configured downlink assignments is done
using a DCI command, which can either deactivate a single configured
downlink assignment or multiple configured downlink assignments
jointly.</p>
<h2 id="uplink-scheduling">10.3 Uplink Scheduling</h2>
<p>In the uplink, the gNB can dynamically allocate resources to UEs via
the C-RNTI on PDCCH(s). A UE always monitors the PDCCH(s) in order to
find possible grants for uplink transmission when its downlink reception
is enabled (activity governed by DRX when configured). When CA is
configured, the same C-RNTI applies to all serving cells.</p>
<p>The gNB may cancel a PUSCH transmission, or a repetition of a PUSCH
transmission, or an SRS transmission of a UE for another UE with a
latency-critical transmission. The gNB can configure UEs to monitor
cancelled transmission indications using CI-RNTI on a PDCCH. If a UE
receives the cancelled transmission indication, the UE shall cancel the
PUSCH transmission from the earliest symbol overlapped with the resource
or the SRS transmission overlapped with the resource indicated by
cancellation (see clause 11.2A of TS 38.213 [38]).</p>
<p>In addition, with Configured Grants, the gNB can allocate uplink
resources for the initial HARQ transmissions and HARQ retransmissions to
UEs. Two types of configured uplink grants are defined:</p>
<p>- With Type 1, RRC directly provides the configured uplink grant
(including the periodicity).</p>
<p>- With Type 2, RRC defines the periodicity of the configured uplink
grant while PDCCH addressed to CS-RNTI can either signal and activate
the configured uplink grant, or deactivate it; i.e. a PDCCH addressed to
CS-RNTI indicates that the uplink grant can be implicitly reused
according to the periodicity defined by RRC, until deactivated.</p>
<p>If the UE is not configured with enhanced intra-UE overlapping
resources prioritization, the dynamically allocated uplink transmission
overrides the configured uplink grant in the same serving cell, if they
overlap in time. Otherwise an uplink transmission according to the
configured uplink grant is assumed, if activated.</p>
<p>If the UE is configured with enhanced intra-UE overlapping resources
prioritization, in case a configured uplink grant transmission overlaps
in time with dynamically allocated uplink transmission or with another
configured uplink grant transmission in the same serving cell, the UE
prioritizes the transmission based on the comparison between the highest
priority of the logical channels that have data to be transmitted and
which are multiplexed or can be multiplexed in MAC PDUs associated with
the overlapping resources. Similarly, in case a configured uplink grant
transmissions or a dynamically allocated uplink transmission overlaps in
time with a scheduling request transmission, the UE prioritizes the
transmission based on the comparison between the priority of the logical
channel which triggered the scheduling request and the highest priority
of the logical channels that have data to be transmitted and which are
multiplexed or can be multiplexed in MAC PDU associated with the
overlapping resource. In case the MAC PDU associated with a
deprioritized transmission has already been generated, the UE keeps it
stored to allow the gNB to schedule a retransmission. The UE may also be
configured by the gNB to transmit the stored MAC PDU as a new
transmission using a subsequent resource of the same configured uplink
grant configuration when an explicit retransmission grant is not
provided by the gNB.</p>
<p>Retransmissions other than repetitions are explicitly allocated via
PDCCH(s) or via configuration of a retransmission timer.</p>
<p>The UE may be configured with up to 12 active configured uplink
grants for a given BWP of a serving cell. When more than one is
configured, the network decides which of these configured uplink grants
are active at a time (including all of them). Each configured uplink
grant can either be of Type 1 or Type 2. For Type 2, activation and
deactivation of configured uplink grants are independent among the
serving cells. When more than one Type 2 configured grant is configured,
each configured grant is activated separately using a DCI command and
deactivation of Type 2 configured grants is done using a DCI command,
which can either deactivate a single configured grant configuration or
multiple configured grant configurations jointly.</p>
<p>When SUL is configured, the network should ensure that an active
configured uplink grant on SUL does not overlap in time with another
active configured uplink grant on the other UL configuration.</p>
<p>For both dynamic grant and configured grant, for a transport block,
two or more repetitions can be in one slot, or across slot boundary in
consecutive available slots with each repetition in one slot. For both
dynamic grant and configured grant Type 2, the number of repetitions can
be also dynamically indicated in the L1 signalling. The dynamically
indicated number of repetitions shall override the RRC configured number
of repetitions, if both are present.</p>
<h2 id="measurements-to-support-scheduler-operation">10.4 Measurements
to Support Scheduler Operation</h2>
<p>Measurement reports are required to enable the scheduler to operate
in both uplink and downlink. These include transport volume and
measurements of a UEs radio environment.</p>
<p>Uplink buffer status reports (BSR) are needed to provide support for
QoS-aware packet scheduling. In NR, uplink buffer status reports refer
to the data that is buffered in for a group of logical channels (LCG) in
the UE. Four formats are used for reporting in uplink:</p>
<p>- A short format to report only one BSR (of one LCG);</p>
<p>- A flexible long format to report several BSRs (up to all eight
LCGs);</p>
<p>- An extended short format to report one BSR (of one LCG);</p>
<p>- An extended long format to report several BSRs (up to all 256
LCGs).</p>
<p>NOTE: The Extended versions of the BSR formats can only be used by
IAB nodes.</p>
<p>Uplink buffer status reports are transmitted using MAC signalling.
When a BSR is triggered (e.g. when new data arrives in the transmission
buffers of the UE), a Scheduling Request (SR) can be transmitted by the
UE (e.g. when no resources are available to transmit the BSR).</p>
<p>For IAB, the Pre-emptive BSR can be configured on the backhaul links.
The Pre-emptive BSR is sent based on expected data rather than buffered
data, as described in clause 4.7.3.3.</p>
<p>Power headroom reports (PHR) are needed to provide support for
power-aware packet scheduling. In NR, three types of reporting are
supported: a first one for PUSCH transmission, a second one for PUSCH
and PUCCH transmission in an LTE Cell Group in EN-DC (see TS 37.340
[21]) and a third one for SRS transmission on SCells configured with SRS
only. In case of CA, when no transmission takes place on an activated
SCell, a reference power is used to provide a virtual report. To allow
network to detect UL power reduction, the PHR reports may also contain
Power Management Maximum Power Reduction (P-MPR, see TS 38.101-2 [35])
information that UE uses to ensure UE compliance with the Maximum
Permissible Exposure (MPE) exposure regulation for FR2, which is set for
limiting RF exposure on human body. Power headroom reports are
transmitted using MAC signalling.</p>
<h2 id="rate-control">10.5 Rate Control</h2>
<h3 id="downlink-1">10.5.1 Downlink</h3>
<p>In downlink, for GBR flows, the gNB guarantees the GFBR and ensures
that the MFBR is not exceeded while for non-GBR flows, it ensures that
the UE-AMBR is not exceeded (see clause 12). When configured for a GBR
flow, the gNB also ensures that the MDBV is not exceeded. When received
and supported, the gNB in addition ensures that the UE-Slice-MBR is not
exceeded as specified in TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<h3 id="uplink-1">10.5.2 Uplink</h3>
<p>The UE has an uplink rate control function which manages the sharing
of uplink resources between logical channels. RRC controls the uplink
rate control function by giving each logical channel a priority, a
prioritised bit rate (PBR), and a buffer size duration (BSD). The values
signalled need not be related to the ones signalled via NG to the gNB.
In addition, mapping restrictions can be configured (see clause
16.1.2).</p>
<p>The uplink rate control function ensures that the UE serves the
logical channel(s) in the following sequence:</p>
<p>1. All relevant logical channels in decreasing priority order up to
their PBR;</p>
<p>2. All relevant logical channels in decreasing priority order for the
remaining resources assigned by the grant.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: In case the PBRs are all set to zero, the first step is
skipped and the logical channels are served in strict priority order:
the UE maximises the transmission of higher priority data.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: The mapping restrictions tell the UE which logical channels
are relevant for the grant received. If no mapping restrictions are
configured, all logical channels are considered.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: Through radio protocol configuration and scheduling, the gNB
can guarantee the GFBR(s) and ensure that any of the MFBR(s), the
UE-AMBR and, when supported and feasible, the UE-Slice-MBR is not
exceeded in uplink (see clause 12).</p>
<p>NOTE 4: The mapping restrictions allows the gNB to fulfil the MDBV
requirements through scheduling at least for the case where logical
channels are mapped to separate serving cells.</p>
<p>If more than one logical channel have the same priority, the UE shall
serve them equally.</p>
<h2 id="activationdeactivation-mechanism">10.6 Activation/Deactivation
Mechanism</h2>
<p>To enable reasonable UE battery consumption when CA is configured, an
activation/deactivation mechanism of Cells is supported. When an SCell
is deactivated, the UE does not need to receive the corresponding PDCCH
or PDSCH, cannot transmit in the corresponding uplink, nor is it
required to perform CQI measurements. Conversely, when an SCell is
active, the UE shall receive PDSCH and PDCCH (if the UE is configured to
monitor PDCCH from this SCell) and is expected to be able to perform CQI
measurements. NG-RAN ensures that while PUCCH SCell (a Secondary Cell
configured with PUCCH) is deactivated, SCells of secondary PUCCH group
(a group of SCells whose PUCCH signalling is associated with the PUCCH
on the PUCCH SCell) should not be activated. NG-RAN ensures that SCells
mapped to PUCCH SCell are deactivated before the PUCCH SCell is changed
or removed.</p>
<p>When reconfiguring the set of serving cells:</p>
<p>- SCells added to the set are initially activated or deactivated;</p>
<p>- SCells which remain in the set (either unchanged or reconfigured)
do not change their activation status (<em>activated</em> or
<em>deactivated</em>).</p>
<p>At handover or connection resume from RRC_INACTIVE:</p>
<p>- SCells are activated or deactivated.</p>
<p>To enable reasonable UE battery consumption when BA is configured,
only one UL BWP for each uplink carrier and one DL BWP or only one DL/UL
BWP pair can be active at a time in an active serving cell, all other
BWPs that the UE is configured with being deactivated. On deactivated
BWPs, the UE does not monitor the PDCCH, does not transmit on PUCCH,
PRACH and UL-SCH.</p>
<p>To enable fast SCell activation when CA is configured, one dormant
BWP can be configured for an SCell. If the active BWP of the activated
SCell is a dormant BWP, the UE stops monitoring PDCCH and transmitting
SRS/PUSCH/PUCCH on the SCell but continues performing CSI measurements,
AGC and beam management, if configured. A DCI is used to control
entering/leaving the dormant BWP for one or more SCell(s) or one or more
SCell group(s).</p>
<p>The dormant BWP is one of the UE's dedicated BWPs configured by
network via dedicated RRC signalling. The SpCell and PUCCH SCell cannot
be configured with a dormant BWP.</p>
<p>To enable fast SCell activation when CA is configured, aperiodic
CSI-RS for tracking for fast SCell activation can be configured for an
SCell to assist AGC and time/frequency synchronization. A MAC CE is used
to trigger activation of one or more SCell(s) and trigger the aperiodic
CSI-RS for tracking for fast SCell activation for a (set of) deactivated
SCell(s).</p>
<h2 id="e-utra-nr-cell-resource-coordination">10.7 E-UTRA-NR Cell
Resource Coordination</h2>
<p>An NR cell may use spectrum that overlaps or is adjacent to spectrum
in use for E-UTRA cells. In this case network signalling enables
coordination of TDM and FDM cell resources between MAC in the gNB and
the corresponding entity in the ng-eNB. Both the gNB and the ng-eNB can
trigger the E-UTRA - NR Cell Resource Coordination procedure over Xn to
its peer node.</p>
<h2 id="cross-carrier-scheduling">10.8 Cross Carrier Scheduling</h2>
<p>Cross-carrier scheduling with the Carrier Indicator Field (CIF)
allows the PDCCH of a serving cell to schedule resources on another
serving cell but with the following restrictions:</p>
<p>- When cross-carrier scheduling from an SCell to PCell is not
configured, PCell can only be scheduled via its PDCCH;</p>
<p>- When cross-carrier scheduling from an SCell to PCell is
configured:</p>
<p>- PDCCH on that SCell can schedule PCell's PDSCH and PUSCH;</p>
<p>- PDCCH on the PCell can schedule PCell's PDSCH and PUSCH but cannot
schedule PDSCH and PUSCH on any other cell;</p>
<p>- Only one SCell can be configured to be used for cross-carrier
scheduling to PCell.</p>
<p>- When an SCell is configured with a PDCCH, that cell's PDSCH and
PUSCH are always scheduled by the PDCCH on this SCell;</p>
<p>- When an SCell is not configured with a PDCCH, that SCell's PDSCH
and PUSCH are always scheduled by a PDCCH on another serving cell;</p>
<p>- The scheduling PDCCH and the scheduled PDSCH/PUSCH can use the same
or different numerologies.</p>
<h2 id="iab-resource-configuration">10.9 IAB Resource Configuration</h2>
<p>If the IAB-DU and the IAB-MT of an IAB-node are subject to a
half-duplex constraint, correct transmission/reception by one cannot be
guaranteed during transmission/reception by the other and vice versa,
e.g., when collocated and operating in the same frequency. If an
IAB-node supports enhanced frequency or spatial multiplexing
capabilities, additional multiplexing modes can be supported, i.e.,
simultaneous operation of IAB-MT Rx / IAB-DU Rx, IAB-MT Tx / IAB-DU Tx,
IAB-MT Rx / IAB-DU Tx, IAB-MT Tx / IAB-DU Rx. An IAB-node can report its
duplexing constraints between the IAB-MT and the collocated IAB-DU via
F1AP. An IAB-node can indicate via F1AP whether or not FDM is required
for an enhanced multiplexing operation.</p>
<p>The scheduler on an IAB-DU or IAB-donor-DU complies with the gNB-DU
resource configuration received via F1AP, which defines the usage of
scheduling resources to account for the aforementioned duplexing
constraint.</p>
<p>The resource configuration assigns an attribute of hard, soft or
unavailable to each symbol of each DU cell. Transmission/reception can
occur for symbols configured as hard, whereas scheduling cannot occur,
except for some special cases, for symbols configures as unavailable.
For symbols configured as soft, scheduling can occur conditionally on an
explicit indication of availability by the parent node via DCI format
2_5, or on an implicit determination of availability by the IAB-node.
The implicit determination of availability is determined by the IAB-node
depending on whether or not the operation of the IAB-DU would have an
impact on the collocated IAB-MT.</p>
<p>The resource configuration can be shared among neighbouring IAB-nodes
and IAB-donors to facilitate interference management, dual connectivity,
and enhanced multiplexing.</p>
<p>To facilitate transitioning from IAB-MT to IAB-DU operation and vice
versa, guard symbols can be used to overcome potentially misaligned
symbol boundaries between the IAB-MT operation and the IAB-DU operation
(e.g., IAB-MT Rx boundaries are not aligned with the IAB-DU Tx
boundaries). Specifically, an IAB-node can indicate to a parent node a
number of desired guard symbols, while the parent node can indicate to
the IAB-node the number of actually provided guard symbols for specific
transitions.</p>
<p>An IAB-node supporting enhanced multiplexing capabilities, i.e.,
IAB-MT Rx / IAB-DU Rx, IAB-MT Tx / IAB-DU Tx, IAB-MT Rx / IAB-DU Tx,
IAB-MT Tx / IAB-DU Rx, can provide via MAC-CE to a parent node
information to facilitate scheduling for enhanced multiplexing operation
by the IAB-node, specifically:</p>
<p>- recommended IAB-MT's Tx/Rx beams;</p>
<p>- desired IAB-MT Tx PSD range;</p>
<p>- desired parent node's IAB-DU Tx power adjustment;</p>
<p>- required IAB-MT's uplink transmission timing mode.</p>
<p>Correspondingly, the parent node can provide information via MAC-CE
to the IAB-node to facilitate enhanced multiplexing at the IAB-node
and/or at the parent node:</p>
<p>- restricted IAB-DU Tx beams;</p>
<p>- actual parent node's IAB-DU Tx power adjustment;</p>
<p>- IAB-MT's uplink transmission timing mode.</p>
<h1 id="ue-power-saving">11 UE Power Saving</h1>
<p>The PDCCH monitoring activity of the UE in RRC connected mode is
governed by DRX, BA, and DCP.</p>
<p>When DRX is configured, the UE does not have to continuously monitor
PDCCH. DRX is characterized by the following:</p>
<p>- <strong>on-duration</strong>: duration that the UE waits for, after
waking up, to receive PDCCHs. If the UE successfully decodes a PDCCH,
the UE stays awake and starts the inactivity timer;</p>
<p>- <strong>inactivity-timer</strong>: duration that the UE waits to
successfully decode a PDCCH, from the last successful decoding of a
PDCCH, failing which it can go back to sleep. The UE shall restart the
inactivity timer following a single successful decoding of a PDCCH for a
first transmission only (i.e. not for retransmissions);</p>
<p>- <strong>retransmission-timer</strong>: duration until a
retransmission can be expected;</p>
<p>- <strong>cycle</strong>: specifies the periodic repetition of the
on-duration followed by a possible period of inactivity (see figure 11-1
below);</p>
<p><strong>- active-time</strong>: total duration that the UE monitors
PDCCH. This includes the "on-duration" of the DRX cycle, the time UE is
performing continuous reception while the inactivity timer has not
expired, and the time when the UE is performing continuous reception
while waiting for a retransmission opportunity.</p>
<p><img src="media/image55.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 11-1: DRX Cycle</p>
<p>A SL UE can be configured with DRX, in which case, PDCCH providing SL
grants can be send to the UE only during its active time.</p>
<p>When BA is configured, the UE only has to monitor PDCCH on the one
active BWP i.e. it does not have to monitor PDCCH on the entire DL
frequency of the cell. A BWP inactivity timer (independent from the DRX
inactivity-timer described above) is used to switch the active BWP to
the default one: the timer is restarted upon successful PDCCH decoding
and the switch to the default BWP takes place when it expires.</p>
<p>In addition, the UE may be indicated, when configured accordingly,
whether it is required to monitor or not the PDCCH during the next
occurrence of the on-duration by a DCP monitored on the active BWP. If
the UE does not detect a DCP on the active BWP, it does not monitor the
PDCCH during the next occurrence of the on-duration, unless it is
explicitly configured to do so in that case.</p>
<p>A UE can only be configured to monitor DCP when connected mode DRX is
configured, and at occasion(s) at a configured offset before the
on-duration. More than one monitoring occasion can be configured before
the on-duration. The UE does not monitor DCP on occasions occurring
during active-time, measurement gaps, BWP switching, or when it monitors
response for a CFRA preamble transmission for beam failure recovery (see
clause 9.2.6), in which case it monitors the PDCCH during the next
on-duration. If no DCP is configured in the active BWP, UE follows
normal DRX operation.</p>
<p>When CA is configured, DCP is only configured on the PCell.</p>
<p>One DCP can be configured to control PDCCH monitoring during
on-duration for one or more UEs independently.</p>
<p>Power saving in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE can also be achieved by UE
relaxing neighbour cells RRM measurements when it meets the criteria
determining it is in low mobility and/or not at cell edge. When UE is
configured with both high speed measurements and RRM measurement
relaxation as specified in TS 38.331 [12], it is up to UE implementation
whether to apply the FR1 high speed RRM requirements or the relaxed RRM
requirements when the low mobility related criterion is configured and
fulfilled as specified in TS 38.133 [13].</p>
<p>UE power saving may be enabled by adapting the DL maximum number of
MIMO layers by BWP switching.</p>
<p>Power saving is also enabled during active-time via cross-slot
scheduling, which facilitates UE to achieve power saving with the
assumption that it won't be scheduled to receive PDSCH, triggered to
receive A-CSI or transmit a PUSCH scheduled by the PDCCH until the
minimum scheduling offsets K0 and K2. Dynamic adaptation of the minimum
scheduling offsets K0 and K2 is controlled by PDCCH.</p>
<p>Serving Cells of a MAC entity may be configured by RRC in two DRX
groups with separate DRX parameters. When RRC does not configure a
secondary DRX group, there is only one DRX group and all Serving Cells
belong to that one DRX group. When two DRX groups are configured, each
Serving Cell is uniquely assigned to either of the two groups. The DRX
parameters that are separately configured for each DRX group are
on-duration and inactivity-timer.</p>
<p>UE power saving in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE may be achieved by providing
the configuration for TRS with CSI-RS for tracking in TRS occasions. The
TRS in TRS occasions may allow UEs in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE to sleep
longer before waking-up for its paging occasion. The TRS occasions
configuration is provided in SIB17. The availability of TRS in the TRS
occasions is indicated by L1 availability indication. These TRSs may
also be used by the UEs configured with eDRX.</p>
<p>UE power saving may be achieved by UE relaxing measurements for
RLM/BFD. When configured, UE determines whether it is in low mobility
state and/or whether its serving cell radio link quality is better than
a threshold. The configuration for low mobility and good serving cell
quality criterion is provided through dedicated RRC signalling.</p>
<p>RLM and BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled separately through RRC
Configuration. Additionally, RLM relaxation may be enabled/disabled on
per Cell Group basis while BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per
serving cell basis.</p>
<p>The UE is only allowed to perform RLM and/or BFD relaxation when
relaxed measurement criterion for low mobility and/or for good serving
cell quality is met. If configured to do so, the UE shall trigger
reporting of its RLM and/or BFD relaxation status through UE assistance
information if the UE changes its respective RLM and/or BFD relaxation
status while meeting the UE minimum requirements specified in TS 38.133
[13].</p>
<p>UE power saving may also be achieved through PDCCH monitoring
adaptation mechanisms when configured by the network, including skipping
of PDCCH monitoring and Search space set group (SSSG) switching. In this
case UE does not monitor PDCCH during the PDCCH skipping duration except
for the cases as specified in TS 38.213 [38], or monitors PDCCH
according to the search space sets applied in SSSG.</p>
<h1 id="qos">12 QoS</h1>
<h2 id="overview-6">12.1 Overview</h2>
<p>The <strong>5G QoS model</strong> is based on QoS Flows (see TS
23.501 [3]) and supports both QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit
rate (GBR QoS Flows) and QoS Flows that do not require guaranteed flow
bit rate (non-GBR QoS Flows). At NAS level (see TS 23.501 [3]), the QoS
flow is thus the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in a PDU
session. A QoS flow is identified within a PDU session by a QoS Flow ID
(QFI) carried in an encapsulation header over NG-U.</p>
<p>The <strong>QoS architecture</strong> in NG-RAN, both for NR
connected to 5GC and for E-UTRA connected to 5GC, is depicted in the
Figure 12-1 and described in the following:</p>
<p>- For each UE, 5GC establishes one or more PDU Sessions;</p>
<p>- Except for NB-IoT and IAB-MT in SA mode, for each UE, the NG-RAN
establishes at least one Data Radio Bearers (DRB) together with the PDU
Session and additional DRB(s) for QoS flow(s) of that PDU session can be
subsequently configured (it is up to NG-RAN when to do so);</p>
<p>- If NB-IoT UE supports NG-U data transfer, the NG-RAN may establish
Data Radio Bearers (DRB) together with the PDU Session and one PDU
session maps to only one DRB;</p>
<p>- The NG-RAN maps packets belonging to different PDU sessions to
different DRBs;</p>
<p>- NAS level packet filters in the UE and in the 5GC associate UL and
DL packets with QoS Flows;</p>
<p>- AS-level mapping rules in the UE and in the NG-RAN associate UL and
DL QoS Flows with DRBs.</p>
<p><img src="media/image56.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 12-1: QoS architecture</p>
<p>NG-RAN and 5GC ensure quality of service (e.g. reliability and target
delay) by mapping packets to appropriate QoS Flows and DRBs. Hence there
is a 2-step mapping of IP-flows to QoS flows (NAS) and from QoS flows to
DRBs (Access Stratum).</p>
<p>At <strong>NAS level</strong>, a QoS flow is characterised by a QoS
profile provided by 5GC to NG-RAN and QoS rule(s) provided by 5GC to the
UE. The QoS profile is used by NG-RAN to determine the treatment on the
radio interface while the QoS rules dictates the mapping between uplink
User Plane traffic and QoS flows to the UE. A QoS flow may either be GBR
or Non-GBR depending on its profile. The QoS profile of a QoS flow
contains QoS parameters, for instance (see TS 23.501 [3]):</p>
<p>- For each QoS flow:</p>
<p>- A 5G QoS Identifier (5QI);</p>
<p>- An Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).</p>
<p>- In case of a GBR QoS flow only:</p>
<p>- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) for both uplink and downlink;</p>
<p>- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) for both uplink and downlink;</p>
<p>- Maximum Packet Loss Rate for both uplink and downlink;</p>
<p>- Delay Critical Resource Type;</p>
<p>- Notification Control.</p>
<p>NOTE: The Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL, DL) is only provided for a
GBR QoS flow belonging to voice media.</p>
<p>- In case of Non-GBR QoS only:</p>
<p>- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA): the RQA, when included, indicates
that some (not necessarily all) traffic carried on this QoS flow is
subject to reflective quality of service (RQoS) at NAS;</p>
<p>- Additional QoS Flow Information.</p>
<p>The QoS parameter Notification Control indicates whether
notifications are requested from the RAN when the GFBR can no longer (or
again) be fulfilled for a QoS Flow. If, for a given GBR QoS Flow,
notification control is enabled and the RAN determines that the GFBR
cannot be guaranteed, RAN shall send a notification towards SMF and keep
the QoS Flow (i.e. while the NG-RAN is not delivering the requested GFBR
for this QoS Flow), unless specific conditions at the NG-RAN require the
release of the NG-RAN resources for this GBR QoS Flow, e.g. due to Radio
link failure or RAN internal congestion. When applicable, NG-RAN sends a
new notification, informing SMF that the GFBR can be guaranteed
again.</p>
<p>If Alternative QoS parameters Sets are received with the Notification
Control parameter, the NG-RAN may also include in the notification a
reference corresponding to the QoS Parameter Set which it can currently
fulfil as specified in TS 23.501 [3]. The target NG-RAN node may include
in the notification control indication the reference to the QoS
Parameter Set which it can currently fulfil over Xn to the source NG-RAN
node during handover.</p>
<p>In addition, an Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate is associated to each PDU
session (Session-AMBR), to each UE (UE-AMBR) and to each slice per UE
(UE-Slice-MBR). The Session-AMBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can
be expected to be provided across all Non-GBR QoS Flows for a specific
PDU Session and is ensured by the UPF. The UE-AMBR limits the aggregate
bit rate that can be expected to be provided across all Non-GBR QoS
Flows of a UE and is ensured by the RAN (see clause 10.5.1). The
UE-Slice-MBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be
provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows corresponding to PDU
Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) as specified in TS
23.501 [3] and is ensured by the RAN (see clause 10.5.1).</p>
<p>The 5QI is associated to QoS characteristics giving guidelines for
setting node specific parameters for each QoS Flow. Standardized or
pre-configured 5G QoS characteristics are derived from the 5QI value and
are not explicitly signalled. Signalled QoS characteristics are included
as part of the QoS profile. The QoS characteristics consist for instance
of (see TS 23.501 [3]):</p>
<p>- Priority level;</p>
<p>- Packet Delay Budget (including Core Network Packet Delay
Budget);</p>
<p>- Packet Error Rate;</p>
<p>- Averaging window;</p>
<p>- Maximum Data Burst Volume.</p>
<p>At <strong>Access Stratum</strong> level, the data radio bearer (DRB)
defines the packet treatment on the radio interface (Uu). A DRB serves
packets with the same packet forwarding treatment. The QoS flow to DRB
mapping by NG-RAN is based on QFI and the associated QoS profiles (i.e.
QoS parameters and QoS characteristics). Separate DRBs may be
established for QoS flows requiring different packet forwarding
treatment, or several QoS Flows belonging to the same PDU session can be
multiplexed in the same DRB.</p>
<p>In the uplink, the mapping of QoS Flows to DRBs is controlled by
mapping rules which are signalled in two different ways:</p>
<p>- Reflective mapping: for each DRB, the UE monitors the QFI(s) of the
downlink packets and applies the same mapping in the uplink; that is,
for a DRB, the UE maps the uplink packets belonging to the QoS flows(s)
corresponding to the QFI(s) and PDU Session observed in the downlink
packets for that DRB. To enable this reflective mapping, the NG-RAN
marks downlink packets over Uu with QFI.</p>
<p>- Explicit Configuration: QoS flow to DRB mapping rules can be
explicitly signalled by RRC.</p>
<p>The UE always applies the latest update of the mapping rules
regardless of whether it is performed via reflecting mapping or explicit
configuration.</p>
<p>When a QoS flow to DRB mapping rule is updated, the UE sends an end
marker on the old bearer.</p>
<p>In the downlink, the QFI is signalled by NG-RAN over Uu for the
purpose of RQoS and if neither NG-RAN, nor the NAS (as indicated by the
RQA) intend to use reflective mapping for the QoS flow(s) carried in a
DRB, no QFI is signalled for that DRB over Uu. In the uplink, NG-RAN can
configure the UE to signal QFI over Uu.</p>
<p>For each PDU session, a default DRB may be configured: if an incoming
UL packet matches neither an RRC configured nor a reflective mapping
rule, the UE then maps that packet to the default DRB of the PDU
session. For non-GBR QoS flows, the 5GC may send to the NG-RAN the
Additional QoS Flow Information parameter associated with certain QoS
flows to indicate that traffic is likely to appear more often on them
compared to other non-GBR QoS flows established on the same PDU
session.</p>
<p>Within each PDU session, it is up to NG-RAN how to map multiple QoS
flows to a DRB. The NG-RAN may map a GBR flow and a non-GBR flow, or
more than one GBR flow to the same DRB, but mechanisms to optimise these
cases are not within the scope of standardization.</p>
<h2 id="explicit-congestion-notification">12.2 Explicit Congestion
Notification</h2>
<p>The gNB and the UE support of the Explicit Congestion Notification
(ECN) is specified in clause 5 of [27].</p>
<h1 id="security">13 Security</h1>
<h2 id="overview-and-principles">13.1 Overview and Principles</h2>
<p>The following principles apply to NR connected to 5GC security, see
TS 33.501 [5]:</p>
<p>- For user data (DRBs), ciphering provides user data confidentiality
and integrity protection provides user data integrity;</p>
<p>- For RRC signalling (SRBs), ciphering provides signalling data
confidentiality and integrity protection signalling data integrity;</p>
<p>NOTE: Ciphering and integrity protections are optionally configured
except for RRC signalling for which integrity protection is always
configured. Ciphering and integrity protection can be configured per DRB
but all DRBs belonging to a PDU session for which the User Plane
Security Enforcement information indicates that UP integrity protection
is required (see TS 23.502 [22]), are configured with integrity
protection.</p>
<p>- For key management and data handling, any entity processing
cleartext shall be protected from physical attacks and located in a
secure environment;</p>
<p>- The gNB (AS) keys are cryptographically separated from the 5GC
(NAS) keys;</p>
<p>- Separate AS and NAS level Security Mode Command (SMC) procedures
are used;</p>
<p>- A sequence number (COUNT) is used as input to the ciphering and
integrity protection and a given sequence number must only be used once
for a given key (except for identical re-transmission) on the same radio
bearer in the same direction.</p>
<p>The keys are organised and derived as follows:</p>
<p>- Key for AMF:</p>
<p>- K<sub>AMF</sub> is a key derived by ME and SEAF from
K<sub>SEAF</sub>.</p>
<p>- Keys for NAS signalling:</p>
<p>- K<sub>NASint</sub> is a key derived by ME and AMF from
K<sub>AMF</sub>, which shall only be used for the protection of NAS
signalling with a particular integrity algorithm;</p>
<p>- K<sub>NASenc</sub> is a key derived by ME and AMF from
K<sub>AMF</sub>, which shall only be used for the protection of NAS
signalling with a particular encryption algorithm.</p>
<p>Key for gNB:</p>
<p>- K<sub>gNB</sub> is a key derived by ME and AMF from
K<sub>AMF</sub>. K<sub>gNB</sub> is further derived by ME and source gNB
when performing horizontal or vertical key derivation.</p>
<p>Keys for UP traffic:</p>
<p>- K<sub>UPenc</sub> is a key derived by ME and gNB from
K<sub>gNB</sub>, which shall only be used for the protection of UP
traffic between ME and gNB with a particular encryption algorithm;</p>
<p>- K<sub>UPint</sub> is a key derived by ME and gNB from
K<sub>gNB</sub>, which shall only be used for the protection of UP
traffic between ME and gNB with a particular integrity algorithm.</p>
<p>Keys for RRC signalling:</p>
<p>- K<sub>RRCint</sub> is a key derived by ME and gNB from
K<sub>gNB</sub>, which shall only be used for the protection of RRC
signalling with a particular integrity algorithm;</p>
<p>- K<sub>RRCenc</sub> is a key derived by ME and gNB from
K<sub>gNB</sub>, which shall only be used for the protection of RRC
signalling with a particular encryption algorithm.</p>
<p>Intermediate keys:</p>
<p>- NH is a key derived by ME and AMF to provide forward security.</p>
<p>- K<sub>gNB</sub>* is a key derived by ME and gNB when performing a
horizontal or vertical key derivation.</p>
<p>The primary authentication enables mutual authentication between the
UE and the network and provide an anchor key called K<sub>SEAF</sub>.
From K<sub>SEAF</sub>, K<sub>AMF</sub> is created during e.g. primary
authentication or NAS key re-keying and key refresh events. Based on
K<sub>AMF</sub>, K<sub>NASint</sub> and K<sub>NASenc</sub> are then
derived when running a successful NAS SMC procedure.</p>
<p>Whenever an initial AS security context needs to be established
between UE and gNB, AMF and the UE derive a K<sub>gNB</sub> and a Next
Hop parameter (NH). The K<sub>gNB</sub> and the NH are derived from the
K<sub>AMF</sub>. A NH Chaining Counter (NCC) is associated with each
K<sub>gNB</sub> and NH parameter. Every K<sub>gNB</sub> is associated
with the NCC corresponding to the NH value from which it was derived. At
initial setup, the K<sub>gNB</sub> is derived directly from
K<sub>AMF</sub>, and is then considered to be associated with a virtual
NH parameter with NCC value equal to zero. At initial setup, the derived
NH value is associated with the NCC value one. On handovers, the basis
for the K<sub>gNB</sub> that will be used between the UE and the target
gNB, called K<sub>gNB</sub>*, is derived from either the currently
active K<sub>gNB</sub> or from the NH parameter. If K<sub>gNB</sub>* is
derived from the currently active K<sub>gNB</sub>, this is referred to
as a horizontal key derivation and is indicated to UE with an NCC that
does not increase. If the K<sub>gNB</sub>* is derived from the NH
parameter, the derivation is referred to as a vertical key derivation
and is indicated to UE with an NCC increase. Finally,
K<sub>RRCint</sub>, K<sub>RRCenc</sub>, K<sub>UPint</sub> and
K<sub>UPenc</sub> are derived based on K<sub>gNB</sub> after a new
K<sub>gNB</sub> is derived. This is depicted on Figure 13.1-1 below:</p>
<p><img src="media/image57.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 13.1-1: 5G Key Derivation</p>
<p>With such key derivation, a gNB with knowledge of a K<sub>gNB</sub>,
shared with a UE, is unable to compute any previous K<sub>gNB</sub> that
has been used between the same UE and a previous gNB, therefore
providing backward security. Similarly, a gNB with knowledge of a
K<sub>gNB</sub>, shared with a UE, is unable to predict any future
K<sub>gNB</sub> that will be used between the same UE and another gNB
after n or more handovers (since NH parameters are only computable by
the UE and the AMF).</p>
<p>The AS SMC procedure is for RRC and UP security algorithms
negotiation and RRC security activation. When AS security context is to
be established in the gNB, the AMF sends the complete UE 5G security
capabilities to the gNB (i.e., all bits for every capability defined in
TS 24.501 [28] and received in NAS signalling). At handover (or at UE
Context retrieval), the complete UE 5G security capabilities are also
sent by the source gNB to the target gNB (or by the last serving gNB to
the receiving gNB respectively). The gNB chooses the ciphering algorithm
which has the highest priority from its configured list and is also
present in the UE 5G security capabilities. The gNB also chooses the
integrity algorithm which has the highest priority from its configured
list and is also present in the UE 5G security capabilities. The chosen
algorithms are indicated to the UE in the AS SMC and this message is
integrity protected. RRC downlink ciphering (encryption) at the gNB
starts after sending the AS SMC message. RRC uplink deciphering
(decryption) at the gNB starts after receiving and successful
verification of the integrity protected AS security mode complete
message from the UE. The UE verifies the validity of the AS SMC message
from the gNB by verifying the integrity of the received message. RRC
uplink ciphering (encryption) at the UE starts after sending the AS
security mode complete message. RRC downlink deciphering (decryption) at
the UE shall start after receiving and successful verification of the AS
SMC message. The RRC Connection Reconfiguration procedure used to add
DRBs shall be performed only after RRC security has been activated as
part of the AS SMC procedure.</p>
<p>A UE connected to 5GC, shall support integrity protected DRBs at any
data rate, up to and including the highest data rate supported by the UE
for both UL and DL. In case of failed integrity check (i.e. faulty or
missing MAC-I), the concerned PDU shall be discarded by the receiving
PDCP entity.</p>
<p>Key refresh is possible for K<sub>gNB</sub>, K<sub>RRC-enc</sub>,
K<sub>RRC-int</sub>, K<sub>UP-enc</sub>, and K<sub>UP-int</sub> and can
be initiated by the gNB when a PDCP COUNTs are about to be re-used with
the same Radio Bearer identity and with the same K<sub>gNB</sub>. Key
re-keying is also possible for the K<sub>gNB</sub>, K<sub>RRC-enc</sub>,
K<sub>RRC-int</sub>, K<sub>UP-enc</sub>, and K<sub>UP-int</sub> and can
be initiated by the AMF when a 5G AS security context different from the
currently active one shall be activated.</p>

<h2 id="state-transitions-and-mobility">13.3 State Transitions and
Mobility</h2>
<p>As a general principle, on RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED transitions, RRC
protection keys and UP protection keys are generated while keys for NAS
protection as well as higher layer keys are assumed to be already
available. These higher layer keys may have been established as a result
of an AKA run, or as a result of a transfer from another AMF during
handover or idle mode mobility see TS 23.502 [22]).</p>
<p>On RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE transitions, the gNBs deletes the keys
it stores for that UE such that state information for idle mode UEs only
has to be maintained in AMF. It is also assumed that gNB does no longer
store state information about the corresponding UE and deletes the
current keys from its memory. In particular, on connected to idle
transitions:</p>
<p>- The gNB and UE delete NH, K<sub>gNB</sub>, K<sub>RRCint</sub>,
K<sub>RRCenc</sub>, K<sub>UPint</sub> and K<sub>UPenc</sub> and related
NCC;</p>
<p>- AMF and UE keeps K<sub>AMF</sub>, K<sub>NASint</sub> and
K<sub>NASenc</sub> stored.</p>
<p>On mobility with vertical key derivation the NH is further bound to
the target PCI and its frequency ARFCN-DL before it is taken into use as
the K<sub>gNB</sub> in the target gNB. On mobility with horizontal key
derivation the currently active K<sub>gNB</sub> is further bound to the
target PCI and its frequency ARFCN-DL before it is taken into use as the
K<sub>gNB</sub> in the target gNB (see clause 13.1). In both cases,
ARFCN-DL is the absolute frequency of SSB of the target PCell.</p>
<p>It is not required to change the AS security algorithms during
intra-gNB-CU handover. If the UE does not receive an indication of new
AS security algorithms during an intra-gNB-CU handover, the UE shall
continue to use the same algorithms as before the handover (see TS
38.331 [12]).</p>
<h1 id="ue-capabilities">14 UE Capabilities</h1>
<p>The UE capabilities in NR rely on a hierarchical structure where each
capability parameter is defined per UE, per duplex mode (FDD/TDD), per
frequency range (FR1/FR2), per band, per band combinations, … as the UE
may support different functionalities depending on those (see TS 38.306
[11]).</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Some capability parameters are always defined per UE (e.g.
SDAP, PDCP and RLC parameters) while some other not always (e.g. MAC and
Physical Layer Parameters).</p>
<p>The UE capabilities in NR do not rely on UE categories: UE categories
associated to fixed peak data rates are only defined for marketing
purposes and not signalled to the network. Instead, the peak data rate
for a given set of aggregated carriers in a band or band combination is
the sum of the peak data rates of each individual carrier in that band
or band combination, where the peak data rate of each individual carrier
is computed according to the capabilities supported for that carrier in
the corresponding band or band combination.</p>
<p>For each block of contiguous serving cells in a band, the set of
features supported thereon is defined in a Feature Set (FS). The UE may
indicate several Feature Sets for a band (also known as feature sets per
band) to advertise different alternative features for the associated
block of contiguous serving cells in that band. The two-dimensional
matrix of feature sets for all the bands of a band combination (i.e. all
the feature sets per band) is referred to as a feature set combination.
In a feature set combination, the number of feature sets per band is
equal to the number of band entries in the corresponding band
combination, and all feature sets per band have the same number of
feature sets. Each band combination is linked to one feature set
combination. This is depicted on Figure 14-1 below:</p>
<p><img src="media/image58.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 14-1: Feature Set Combinations</p>
<p>In addition, for some features in intra-band contiguous CA, the UE
reports its capabilities individually per carrier. Those capability
parameters are sent in feature set per component carrier and they are
signalled in the corresponding FSs (per Band) i.e. for the corresponding
block of contiguous serving cells in a band. The capability applied to
each individual carrier in a block is agnostic to the order in which
they are signalled in the corresponding FS.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: For intra-band non-contiguous CA, there are as many feature
sets per band signalled as the number of (groups of contiguous) carriers
that the UE is able to aggregate non-contiguously in the corresponding
band.</p>
<p>To limit signalling overhead, the gNB can request the UE to provide
NR capabilities for a restricted set of bands. When responding, the UE
can skip a subset of the requested band combinations according to the UE
capability fallback behaviour as specified in TS 38.306 [11] and in TS
38.331 [12].</p>
<p>If supported by the UE and the network, the UE may provide an ID in
NAS signalling that represents its radio capabilities for one or more
RATs in order to reduce signalling overhead. The ID may be assigned
either by the manufacturer or by the serving PLMN. The
manufacturer-assigned ID corresponds to a pre-provisioned set of
capabilities. In the case of the PLMN-assigned ID, assignment takes
place in NAS signalling.</p>
<p>The AMF stores the UE Radio Capability uploaded by the gNB as
specified in TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<p>The gNB can request the UE capabilities for RAT-Types NR, EUTRA,
UTRA-FDD. The UTRAN capabilities, i.e. the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO,
include START-CS, START-PS and "predefined configurations", which are
"dynamic" IEs. In order to avoid the START values desynchronisation and
the key replaying issue, the gNB always requests the UE UTRA-FDD
capabilities before handover to UTRA-FDD. The gNB does not upload the UE
UTRA-FDD capabilities to the AMF.</p>

Neighbour Cell Relation Function</h3>
<h4 id="general-2">15.3.3.1 General</h4>
<p>The purpose of ANR function is to relieve the operator from the
burden of manually managing NCRs. Figure 15.3.3.1-1 shows ANR and its
environment:</p>
<p><img src="media/image59.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 15.3.3.1-1: Interaction between gNB and OAM due to ANR</p>
<p>The ANR function resides in the gNB and manages the Neighbour Cell
Relation Table (NCRT). Located within ANR, the Neighbour Detection
Function finds new neighbours and adds them to the NCRT. ANR also
contains the Neighbour Removal Function which removes outdated NCRs. The
Neighbour Detection Function and the Neighbour Removal Function are
implementation specific.</p>
<p>An existing NCR from a source cell to a target cell means that gNB
controlling the source cell:</p>
<p>a) Knows the global and physical IDs (e.g. NR CGI/NR PCI, ECGI/PCI)
of the target cell; and</p>
<p>b) Has an entry in the NCRT for the source cell identifying the
target cell; and</p>
<p>c) Has the attributes in this NCRT entry defined, either by OAM or
set to default values.</p>
<p>NCRs are cell-to-cell relations, while an Xn link is set up between
two gNBs. Neighbour Cell Relations are unidirectional, while an Xn link
is bidirectional.</p>
<p>NOTE: The neighbour information exchange, which occurs during the Xn
Setup procedure or in the gNB Configuration Update procedure, may be
used for ANR purpose.</p>
<p>The ANR function also allows OAM to manage the NCRT. OAM can add and
delete NCRs. It can also change the attributes of the NCRT. The OAM
system is informed about changes in the NCRT.</p>

<p>ANR relies on NCGI (see clause 8.2) and ANR reporting of E-UTRA cells
as specified in TS 36.300 [2].</p>
<p><img src="media/image60.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 15.3.3.2-1: Automatic Neighbour Relation Function</p>
<p>Figure 15.3.3.2-1 depicts an example where the NG-RAN node serving
cell A has an ANR function. In RRC_CONNECTED, the NG-RAN node instructs
each UE to perform measurements on neighbour cells. The NG-RAN node may
use different policies for instructing the UE to do measurements, and
when to report them to the NG-RAN node. This measurement procedure is as
specified in TS 38.331[12] and TS 36.331 [29].</p>
<p>1. The UE sends a measurement report regarding cell B. This report
contains Cell B's PCI, but not its NCGI/ECGI.</p>
<p>When the NG-RAN node receives a UE measurement report containing the
PCI, the following sequence may be used.</p>
<p>2. The NG-RAN node instructs the UE, using the newly discovered PCI
as parameter, to read all the broadcast NCGI(s) /ECGI(s), TAC(s),
RANAC(s), PLMN ID(s) and, for neighbour NR cells, NR frequency band(s)
and the gNB ID length(s). To do so, the NG-RAN node may need to schedule
appropriate idle periods to allow the UE to read the NCGI/ECGI from the
broadcast channel of the detected neighbour cell. How the UE reads the
NCGI/ECGI is specified in TS 38.331 [12] and TS 36.331 [29].</p>
<p>3. When the UE has found out the new cell's NCGI(s) /ECGI(s), the UE
reports all the broadcast NCGI(s)/ECGI(s) to the serving cell NG-RAN
node. In addition, the UE reports all the tracking area code(s),
RANAC(s), PLMN IDs and, for neighbour NR cells, NR frequency band(s),
and the gNB ID length(s) that have been read by the UE. In case the
detected NR cell does not broadcast SIB1, the UE may report
<em>noSIB1</em> indication as specified in TS 38.331 [12].</p>
<p>4. The NG-RAN node decides to add this neighbour relation, and can
use PCI and NCGI(s)/ECGI(s) to:</p>
<p>a. Lookup a transport layer address to the new NG-RAN node;</p>
<p>b. Update the Neighbour Cell Relation List;</p>
<p>c. If needed, setup a new Xn interface towards this NG-RAN node.</p>

<p>1 The NG-RAN node instructs a UE to look for neighbour cells in the
target system. To do so the NG-RAN node may need to schedule appropriate
idle periods to allow the UE to scan all cells in the target system.</p>

<p>3 The NG-RAN node instructs the UE, using the newly discovered PCI as
parameter, to read the ECGI, the TAC and all available PLMN ID(s) of the
newly detected cell in case of E-UTRA detected cells. The UE ignores
transmissions from the serving cell while finding the requested
information transmitted in the broadcast channel of the detected
inter-system/inter-frequency neighbour cell. To do so, the NG-RAN node
may need to schedule appropriate idle periods to allow the UE to read
the requested information from the broadcast channel of the detected
inter-system neighbour cell.</p>
<p>4 After the UE has read the requested information in the new cell, it
reports the detected ECGI, TAC, and available PLMN ID(s) to the serving

<p>If the NG-RAN node is aware of the RAN node ID of the candidate
NG-RAN node (e.g. via the ANR function) but not of a TNL address
suitable for SCTP connectivity, then the NG-RAN node can utilize the 5GC
(an AMF it is connected to) to determine the TNL address as follows:</p>
<p>- The NG-RAN node sends the UPLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message
to the AMF to request the TNL address of the candidate NG-RAN node, and
includes relevant information such as the source and target RAN node
ID;</p>
<p>- The AMF relays the request by sending the DOWNLINK RAN
CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to the candidate NG-RAN node identified
by the target RAN node ID;</p>
<p>- The candidate NG-RAN node responds by sending the UPLINK RAN
CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message containing one or more TNL addresses to
be used for SCTP connectivity with the initiating NG-RAN node, and
includes other relevant information such as the source and target RAN
node ID;</p>
<p>- The AMF relays the response by sending the DOWNLINK CONFIGURATION
TRANSFER message to the initiating NG-RAN node identified by the target
RAN node ID.</p>
<p>NOTE: Void.</p>
<p>The NG-RAN node may determine the gNB ID length of the candidate gNB
based on, e.g.OAM configuration or UE reporting in ANR function. If the
NG-RAN node is not able to make this determination, it may include the
NR cell identifier in the UPLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to
the AMF. The AMF may, if supported, determine the target gNB ID by
matching the NR cell identifier with a gNB ID of a gNB it connects
to.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-energy-saving">15.4 Support for Energy Saving</h2>
<h3 id="general-3">15.4.1 General</h3>
<p>The aim of this function is to reduce operational expenses through
energy savings.</p>
<p>The function allows, for example in a deployment where capacity
boosters can be distinguished from cells providing basic coverage, to
optimize energy consumption enabling the possibility for an E-UTRA or NR
cell providing additional capacity via single or dual connectivity, to
be switched off when its capacity is no longer needed and to be
re-activated on a need basis.</p>
<h3 id="solution-description">15.4.2 Solution description</h3>
<h4 id="intra-system-energy-saving">15.4.2.1 Intra-system energy
saving</h4>
<p>The solution builds upon the possibility for the NG-RAN node owning a
capacity booster cell to autonomously decide to switch-off such cell to
lower energy consumption (inactive state). The decision is typically
based on cell load information, consistently with configured
information. The switch-off decision may also be taken by O&amp;M.</p>
<p>The NG-RAN node may initiate handover actions in order to off-load
the cell being switched off and may indicate the reason for handover
with an appropriate cause value to support the target node in taking
subsequent actions, e.g. when selecting the target cell for subsequent
handovers.</p>
<p>All neighbour NG-RAN nodes are informed by the NG-RAN node owning the
concerned cell about the switch-off actions over the Xn interface, by
means of the NG-RAN node Configuration Update procedure.</p>
<p>All informed nodes maintain the cell configuration data, e.g.,
neighbour relationship configuration, also when a certain cell is
inactive. If basic coverage is ensured by NG-RAN node cells, NG-RAN node
owning non-capacity boosting cells may request a re-activation over the
Xn interface if capacity needs in such cells demand to do so. This is
achieved via the Cell Activation procedure. During switch off time
period of the boost cell, the NG-RAN node may prevent idle mode UEs from
camping on this cell and may prevent incoming handovers to the same
cell.</p>
<p>The NG-RAN node receiving a request should act accordingly. The
switch-on decision may also be taken by O&amp;M. All peer NG-RAN nodes
are informed by the NG-RAN node owning the concerned cell about the
re-activation by an indication on the Xn interface.</p>
<h4 id="inter-system-energy-saving">15.4.2.2 Inter-system energy
saving</h4>
<p>The solution builds upon the possibility for the NG-RAN node owning a
capacity booster cell to autonomously decide to switch-off such cell to
dormant state. The decision is typically based on cell load information,
consistently with configured information. The switch-off decision may
also be taken by O&amp;M. The NG-RAN node indicates the switch-off
action to the eNB over NG interface and S1 interface. The NG-RAN node
could also indicate the switch-on action to the eNB over NG interface
and S1 interface.</p>
<p>The eNB providing basic coverage may request a NG-RAN node's cell
re-activation based on its own cell load information or neighbour cell
load information, the switch-on decision may also be taken by O&amp;M.
The eNB requests a NG-RAN node's cell re-activation and receives the
NG-RAN node's cell re-activation reply from the NG-RAN node over the S1
interface and NG interface. Upon reception of the re-activation request,
the NG-RAN node's cell should remain switched on at least until
expiration of the minimum activation time. The minimum activation time
may be configured by O&amp;M or be left to the NG-RAN node's
implementation.</p>
<h3 id="om-requirements">15.4.3 O&amp;M requirements</h3>
<p>Operators should be able to configure the energy saving function.</p>

<p>- The ability of an NG-RAN node to request the re-activation of a
configured list of inactive cells owned by a peer NG-RAN node.</p>

<p>- policies used by the NG-RAN node for cell switch-off decision;</p>
<p>- policies used by peer NG-RAN nodes for requesting the re-activation

<h3 id="support-for-mobility-load-balancing">15.5.1 Support for Mobility
Load Balancing</h3>
<h4 id="general-4">15.5.1.1 General</h4>
<p>The objective of mobility load balancing is to distribute load evenly
among cells and among areas of cells, or to transfer part of the traffic
from congested cell or from congested areas of cells, or to offload
users from one cell, cell area, carrier or RAT to achieve network energy
saving. This can be done by means of optimization of cell
reselection/handover parameters and handover actions. The automation of
such optimisation can provide high quality user experience, while
simultaneously improving the system capacity and also to minimize human
intervention in the network management and optimization tasks.</p>
<p>Intra-RAT, intra-system inter-RAT and inter-system load balancing
scenarios are supported.</p>
<p>In general, support for mobility load balancing consists of one or
more of following functions:</p>
<p>- Load reporting for intra-RAT and intra-system inter-RAT load
balancing;</p>
<p>- Load balancing action based on handovers;</p>
<p>- Adapting handover and/or reselection configuration;</p>
<p>- Load reporting for inter-system load balancing.</p>

Load reporting for intra-RAT and intra-system inter-RAT load
balancing</h4>
<p>The load reporting function is executed by exchanging load
information over the Xn/X2/F1/E1 interfaces.</p>
<p>The following load related information should be supported which
consists of:</p>
<p>- Radio resource usage (per-cell and per SSB area PRB usage: DL/UL
GBR PRB usage, DL/UL non-GBR PRB usage, DL/UL total PRB usage, and DL/UL
scheduling PDCCH CCE usage; PRB usage for slice(s): DL/UL GBR PRB usage,
DL/UL non-GBR PRB usage, and DL/UL Total PRB allocation);</p>
<p>- TNL capacity indicator (UL/DL TNL offered capacity and available
capacity);</p>
<p>- Cell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);</p>
<p>- Capacity value (per cell, per SSB area and per slice: UL/DL
available capacity);</p>
<p>- HW capacity indicator (offered throughput and available throughput
over E1, percentage utilisation over F1);</p>
<p>- RRC connections (number of RRC connections, and available RRC
Connection Capacity);</p>
<p>- Number of active UEs.</p>
<p>To achieve load reporting function, Resource Status Reporting
Initiation &amp; Resource Status Reporting procedures are used.</p>
<p>15.5.1.3 Load balancing action based on handovers</p>
<p>The source cell may initiate handover due to load. The target cell
performs admission control for the load balancing handovers. A handover
preparation related to a mobility load balancing action is
distinguishable from other handovers, so that the target cell is able to
apply appropriate admission control.</p>
<h4 id="adapting-handover-andor-reselection-configuration">15.5.1.4
Adapting handover and/or reselection configuration</h4>
<p>This function enables requesting of a change of handover and/or
reselection parameters at target cell. The source cell that initialized
the load balancing estimates if it is needed to change mobility
configuration in the source and/or target cell. If the amendment is
needed, the source cell initializes mobility negotiation procedure
toward the target cell.</p>
<p>The source cell informs the target cell about the new mobility
setting and provides cause for the change (e.g. load balancing related
request). The proposed change is expressed by the means of the
difference (delta) between the current and the new values of the
handover trigger. The handover trigger is the cell specific offset that
corresponds to the threshold at which a cell initialises the handover
preparation procedure. Cell reselection configuration may be amended to
reflect changes in the HO setting. The target cell responds to the
information from the source cell. The allowed delta range for HO trigger
parameter may be carried in the failure response message. The source
cell should consider the responses before executing the planned change
of its mobility setting.</p>
<p>All automatic changes on the HO and/or reselection parameters must be
within the range allowed by OAM.</p>
<h4 id="load-reporting-for-inter-system-load-balancing">15.5.1.5 Load
reporting for inter-system load balancing</h4>
<p>The load reporting function for inter-system load balancing is
executed by exchanging load information between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN. Both
event-triggered and periodic inter-system load reporting are supported.
Event-triggered inter-system load reports are sent when the reporting
node detects crossing of cell load thresholds.</p>
<p>The following load related information should be supported:</p>
<p>- Cell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);</p>
<p>- Capacity value (per cell: UL/DL available capacity);</p>
<p>- RRC connections (number of RRC connections, and available RRC
Connection Capacity);</p>
<p>- Number of active UEs;</p>
<p>- Radio Resource Status (per cell PRB usage: UL/DL GBR PRB usage for
MIMO, DL/UL non-GBR PRB usage for MIMO, DL/UL total PRB usage for
MIMO).</p>

<p>Mobility Robustness Optimisation aims at detecting and enabling
correction of following problems:</p>
<p>- Connection failure due to intra-system or inter-system
mobility;</p>
<p>- Inter-system Unnecessary HO (too early inter-system HO from NR to
E-UTRAN with no radio link failure);</p>
<p>- Inter-system HO ping-pong;</p>

<h4 id="connection-failure">15.5.2.2 Connection failure</h4>
<h5 id="general-6">15.5.2.2.1 General</h5>
<p>For analysis of connection failures, the UE makes the RLF Report
available to the network.</p>
<p>The UE stores the latest RLF Report, including both LTE and NR RLF
report until the RLF report is fetched by the network or for 48 hours
after the connection failure is detected.</p>
<p>The UE only indicates RLF report availability and only provides the
RLF report to the network if the current RPLMN is a PLMN that was
present in the UE's EPLMN List or was the RPLMN at the time the
connection failure was detected. In case RLF happens in an E-UTRA cell,
the UE makes the LTE RLF Report available to NG-RAN nodes and eNB(s),
and in case RLF happens in an NR cell the UE makes the NR RLF Report
available to gNB(s).</p>
<p>If the LTE RLF Report is reported to a NG-RAN node, and the last
serving node is an E-UTRAN node, the NG-RAN node may transfer it to the
E-UTRAN node by triggering the Uplink RAN configuration transfer
procedure over NG and the E-UTRAN node can take this into account as
defined in TS 36.300 [2].</p>
<h5 id="connection-failure-due-to-intra-system-mobility">15.5.2.2.2
Connection failure due to intra-system mobility</h5>
<p>One of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect
connection failures that occur due to Too Early or Too Late Handovers,
or Handover to Wrong Cell. These problems are defined as follows:</p>
<p>- Intra-system Too Late Handover: an RLF occurs after the UE has
stayed for a long period of time in the cell; the UE attempts to
re-establish the radio link connection in a different cell.</p>
<p>- Intra-system Too Early Handover: an RLF occurs shortly after a
successful handover from a source cell to a target cell or a handover
failure occurs during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to
re-establish the radio link connection in the source cell.</p>
<p>- Intra-system Handover to Wrong Cell: an RLF occurs shortly after a
successful handover from a source cell to a target cell or a handover
failure occurs during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to
re-establish the radio link connection in a cell other than the source
cell and the target cell.</p>
<p>In the definition above, the "successful handover" refers to the UE
state, namely the successful completion of the RA procedure.</p>
<p>In case of CHO, the Too Late Handover, Too Early Handover and
Handover to Wrong Cell in the definition above means Too Late CHO
Execution, Too Early CHO Execution and CHO Execution to Wrong Cell.</p>
<p><strong>Detection mechanism</strong></p>
<p>A failure indication may be initiated after a UE attempts to
re-establish the radio link connection at NG-RAN node B after a failure
at NG-RAN node A. NG-RAN node B may initiate the Failure Indication
procedure towards multiple NG-RAN nodes if they control cells which use
the PCI signalled by the UE during the re-establishment procedure. The
NG-RAN node receiving this selects the UE context that matches the
received Failure Cell ID and C-RNTI, and, if available, uses the
shortMAC-I to confirm this identification, by calculating the shortMAC-I
and comparing it to the received IE.</p>
<p>A failure indication may also be sent to the node last serving the UE
when the NG-RAN node fetches the RLF REPORT from UE by triggering:</p>
<p>- The Failure Indication procedure over Xn;</p>
<p>- The Uplink RAN configuration transfer procedure and Downlink RAN
configuration transfer procedure over NG.</p>
<p>The detailed detection mechanisms for too late handover, too early
handover and handover to wrong cell are carried out through the
following in the NG-RAN node that served the UE before the reported
connection failure:</p>
<p>- Intra-system Too Late Handover: there is no recent handover for the
UE prior to the connection failure e.g. the UE reported timer is absent
or larger than the configured threshold (e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt), or if
CHO is configured but the CHO execution is not initiated for the UE
prior to the connection failure, e.g. the UE reported timer is absent or
larger than the configured threshold (e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt).</p>
<p>- Intra-system Too Early Handover: there is a recent handover for the
UE prior to the connection failure e.g. the UE reported timer is smaller
than the configured threshold (e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt), and the first
re-establishment attempt cell/the successful re-connect cell is the cell
that served the UE at the last handover initialisation or fall back to
the source cell configuration in case of DAPS HO.</p>
<p>- Intra-system Handover to Wrong Cell: there is a recent handover for
the UE prior to the connection failure e.g. the UE reported timer is
smaller than the configured threshold (e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt), and the
first re-establishment attempt cell/ the cell UE attempts to
re-connect/the cell UE attempts CHO recovery is neither the cell that
served the UE at the last handover initialisation nor the cell that
served the UE where the RLF happened or the cell that the handover was
initialized toward.</p>
<p>The "UE reported timer" above indicates the time elapsed since the
last handover initialisation until connection failure or the time
elapsed since the CHO execution until connection failure.</p>
<p>In case of Too Early Handover or Handover to Wrong Cell, the NG-RAN
node receiving the failure indication may inform the NG-RAN node
controlling the cell where the mobility configuration caused the failure
by means of the Handover Report procedure over Xn or the Uplink RAN
Configuration Transfer procedure over NG. This may include the RLF
report.</p>
<p><strong>Retrieval of information needed for problem
analysis</strong></p>
<p>In order to retrieve relevant information collected at the network
side as part of the UE context, the UE provides C-RNTI used in the last
serving cell. If the cause for the failure is identified as a "Too Early
HO" or a "HO to Wrong Cell", the NG-RAN node controlling the last
serving cell shall, include in the HANDOVER REPORT message the C-RNTI
used in the source cell of the last completed handover before the
failure. If the NG RAN node controlling that source cell provided the
Mobility Information, it is also included in the HANDOVER REPORT
message. If used, the Mobility Information is prepared at the source NG
RAN node of a handover and may refer to or identify any handover-related
data at this NG RAN node.</p>
<p><strong>Handling multiple reports from a single failure
event</strong></p>
<p>In case the RRC re-establishment fails and the RRC connection setup
succeeds, MRO evaluation of intra-RAT mobility connection failures may
be triggered twice for the same failure event. In this case, only one
failure event should be counted.</p>

stayed in a cell belonging to an NG-RAN node for a long period of time;
the UE attempts to re-connect to a cell belonging to an E-UTRAN

<p><strong>Detection mechanism</strong></p>
<p>A failure indication may be sent to the node last serving the UE when
the NG-RAN node fetches the RLF REPORT from UE by triggering:</p>

configuration transfer procedure over NG.</p>

mechanisms for Too Late Inter-system Handover and Too Early Inter-system
Handover are carried out through the following:</p>
<p>- Too Late Inter-system Handover: the connection failure occurs while
being connected to a NG-RAN node, and there is no recent handover for
the UE prior to the connection failure i.e., the UE reported timer is
absent or larger than the configured threshold, e.g.,
<em>Tstore_UE_cntxt</em>, and the first node where the UE attempts to
re-connect is a E-UTRAN node.</p>
<p>- Too Early Inter-system Handover: the connection failure occurs
while being connected to a NG-RAN node, and there is a recent
inter-system handover for the UE prior to the connection failure i.e.,
the UE reported timer is smaller than the configured threshold, e.g.,
<em>Tstore_UE_cntxt</em>, and the first cell where the UE attempts to
re-connect and the node that served the UE at the last handover
initialisation are both E-UTRAN node.</p>
<p>The "UE reported timer" above indicates the time elapsed since the
last handover initialisation until connection failure. The UE may make
the RLF Report available to an NG-RAN node. The NG-RAN node may forward
the information using the FAILURE INDICATION message over Xn or by means
of the Uplink RAN configuration transfer procedure and Downlink RAN
configuration transfer over NG to the node that served the UE before the
reported connection failure.</p>
<p>In case the failure is a Too Early Inter-system Handover, the NG-RAN
node receiving the failure indication may inform the E-UTRAN node by
means of the Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer procedure over NG. This
may include the RLF report.</p>
<h4 id="inter-system-unnecessary-ho">15.5.2.3 Inter-system Unnecessary
HO</h4>
<p>One of the purposes of inter-system Mobility Robustness Optimisation
is the detection of a non-optimal use of network resources. In
particular, in case of inter-system operations and when NR is
considered, the case known as Unnecessary HO to another system is
identified. The problem is defined as follows:</p>
<p>- UE is handed over from NR to E-UTRAN even though quality of the NR
coverage was sufficient for the service used by the UE. The handover may
therefore be considered as unnecessary HO to another system (i.e. EPS)
(too early inter-system HO without connection failure).</p>
<p>In inter-system HO, if the serving cell threshold (NR cell) is set
too high, and cell in another system (i.e. EPS) with good signal
strength is available, a handover to another system may be triggered
unnecessarily, resulting in an inefficient use of the networks. With a
lower threshold the UE could have continued in the source system
(5GS).</p>
<p>To be able to detect the Unnecessary HO to another system, a gNB node
may choose to put additional coverage and quality condition information
into the HANDOVER REQUIRED message in the Handover Preparation procedure
when an inter-system HO from gNB to another system occurs. The RAN node
in the other system, upon receiving this additional coverage and quality
information, may instruct the UE to continue measuring the cell(s) in
source system during a period of time, while being connected to another
system, and send periodic or single measurement reports to the node in
other system. When the period of time indicated by the node in source
system expires, the RAN node in the other system, may evaluate the
received measurement reports with the coverage/quality condition
received during the inter-system HO procedure and decide if an
inter-system unnecessary HO report should be sent to the gNB in the
source system.</p>
<p>The inter-system unnecessary HO report shall only be sent in cases
where, in all UE measurement reports collected during the measurement
period, any cells in the source system exceed the radio coverage and/or
quality threshold (the radio threshold RSRP, RSRQ or/and SINR and the
measurement period are indicated in the additional coverage and quality
information in the Handover Preparation procedure). If an inter-system
handover towards 5GS is executed from EPS within the indicated
measurement period, the measurement period expires. In this case, the
eNB in EPS may also send the HO Report. No HO Report shall be sent in
case no NR cell could be included, or if the indicated period of time is
interrupted by an inter-system handover to a system different than
5GS.</p>
<p>The RAN node in the source system (5GS) upon receiving of the report,
can decide if/how its parameters (e.g., threshold to trigger
Inter-system HO) should be adjusted.</p>
<h4 id="inter-system-ping-pong">15.5.2.4 Inter-system Ping-pong</h4>
<p>One of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect
ping-pongs that occur in inter-system environment. The problem is
defined as follows:</p>
<p>- A UE is handed over from a cell in a source system (e.g. 5GS) to a
cell in a target system different from the source system (e.g. EPS),
then within a predefined limited time the UE is handed over back to a
cell in the source system, while the coverage of the source system was
sufficient for the service used by the UE. The event may occur more than
once.</p>
<p>The solution for the problem may consist of the following steps:</p>
<p>1) Statistics regarding inter-system ping-pong occurrences are
collected by the responsible node;</p>
<p>2) Coverage verification is performed to check if the mobility to
other system was inevitable.</p>
<p>The statistics regarding ping-pong occurrence may be based on
evaluation of the <em>UE History Information</em> IE in the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message. If the evaluation indicates a potential ping-pong case
and the source NG_RAN node of the 1<sup>st</sup> inter-system handover
is different than the target NG-RAN node of the 2<sup>nd</sup>
inter-system handover, the target NG-RAN node may use the HANDOVER
REPORT message or the UPLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to
indicate the occurrence of potential ping-pong cases to the source
NG-RAN node.</p>
<p>If NG-RAN coverage during the potential ping-pong event needs to be
verified for the purpose of determining corrective measures, the
Unnecessary HO to another system procedure may be used</p>
<h4 id="om-requirements-1">15.5.2.5 O&amp;M Requirements</h4>
<p>All automatic changes of the HO and/or reselection parameters for
mobility robustness optimisation shall be within the ranges allowed by
OAM and specified below.</p>
<p>The following control parameters shall be provided by OAM to control
MRO behaviour:</p>
<p>- Maximum deviation of Handover Trigger: this parameter defines the
maximum allowed absolute deviation of the Handover Trigger, from the
default point of operation defined by the parameter values assigned by
OAM.</p>
<p>- Minimum time between Handover Trigger changes: this parameter
defines the minimum allowed time interval between two Handover Trigger
change performed by MRO. This is used to control the stability and
convergence of the algorithm.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in order to support the solutions for detection of
mobility optimisation, the parameter <em>Tstore_UE_cntxt</em> shall be
configurable by the OAM system.</p>
<h4 id="pscell-change-failure">15.5.2.6 PSCell change failure</h4>
<p>For analysis of PSCell change failures, the UE makes the SCG Failure
Information available to the MN. If the MN can perform an initial
analysis, it transfers the SCG Failure Information together with the
analysis results to the relevant SN which is responsible for the PSCell
change failures. Otherwise, the MN transfers the SCG Failure Information
to the last serving SN, which may respond using the SCG Failure Transfer
procedure to inform the MN it is not responsible for the SCG failure. If
needed, the MN transfer the SCG Failure Information to the source
SN.</p>
<h4 id="successful-ho">15.5.2.7 Successful HO</h4>
<p>One of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect
a sub-optimal successful handover event. The aim is to identify
underlying conditions during successful ordinary handovers, successful
DAPS handovers, or successful Conditional handovers.</p>
<p>For analysis of successful handover, the UE supports Successful
Handover Report based on configuration by network, if received, and
makes the Successful Handover Report available to the network as
specified in TS 38.331 [12].</p>
<p>The UE stores the Successful Handover Report until the Successful
Handover Report is fetched by the network or for 48 hours after the
Successful Handover Report is recorded.</p>
<p>When the target NR node fetches the Successful HO Report from UE, it
may forward the information to the source node, i.e the node handling
the cell reported as source cell in this Successful HO Report, by using
the ACCESS AND MOBILITY INDICATION message over Xn or by means of the
Uplink RAN configuration transfer procedure and Downlink RAN
configuration transfer over NG.</p>
<p>In case of failure shortly after successful Handover, the same
mobility event may generate both a SHR and a RLF report. In this case,
the node(s), which configured the SHR trigger causing the SHR, may take
the duplication into account e.g. ignore the SHR.</p>
<p>Upon retrieval of a Successful Handover Report, the receiving node
may analyse whether its mobility configuration needs adjustment.</p>
<p>The SHR report can be used to detect one case of Intra-system Too
Late Handover, namely when DAPS HO is configured but an RLF is detected
in the source cell during a successful DAPS HO.</p>
<h3 id="support-for-rach-optimization">15.5.3 Support for RACH
Optimization</h3>
<p>RACH optimization is supported by UE reported information made
available at the NG RAN node as specified in TS 38.331 [12] and by PRACH
parameters exchange between NG RAN nodes.</p>
<p>The contents of the RACH information report comprise of the
following:</p>
<p>- Contention detection indication per RACH attempt;</p>
<p>- Indexes of the SSBs and number of RACH preambles sent on each tried
SSB listed in chronological order of attempts;</p>
<p>- Indication whether the selected SSB is above or below the
configured RSRP threshold per RACH attempt;</p>
<p>- 2-step RACH information as specified in clause 5.7.10.4 of TS
38.331 [12].</p>
<p>The UE operating in NR-DC, may also support SgNB RACH information
report.</p>
<h3 id="ue-history-information-from-the-ue">15.5.4 UE History
Information from the UE</h3>
<p>The source NG-RAN node collects and stores the UE History Information
for as long as the UE stays in one of its cells.</p>
<p>The UE may report the UE history information when connecting to a
cell of the NG-RAN node, consisting of PCell and PSCell mobility history
information, as specified in TS 38.331 [12].</p>
<p>When information needs to be discarded because the list is full, such
information will be discarded in order of its position in the list,
starting with the oldest cell record. If the list is full, and the UE
history information from the UE is available, the UE history information
from the UE should also be discarded.</p>
<p>The resulting information is then used in subsequent handover
preparations by means of the Handover Preparation procedures over the NG
and XN interfaces, which provide the target NG-RAN node with a list of
previously visited cells and associated (per-cell) information elements.
The Handover Preparation procedures also trigger the target NG-RAN node
to start collection and storage of UE history Information and thus to
propagate the collected information.</p>
<p>In case of CHO, the target NG-RAN node updates the time UE stayed in
cell of the latest PCell entry (i.e. the source cell) when the UE
successfully accesses a candidate cell of the target NG-RAN node. The
updated value of the time UE stayed in the source cell is equal to the
value received from the source NG-RAN node during the Handover
Preparation plus the time from receiving the Handover Request message
from the source NG-RAN node to receiving the RRC Reconfiguration
Complete message from the UE. When the target NG-RAN node receives the
SCG UHI from the source NG-RAN node via the Handover Request message,
the target NG-RAN node also updates the time UE stayed in cell of the
latest PSCell entry (i.e. the source PSCell) as specified in TS 37.340
[21].</p>

<p>The objective of NR Coverage and Capacity Optimization (CCO) function
is to detect and resolve or mitigate CCO issues, e.g. coverage and cell
edge interference issues.</p>
<h4 id="oam-requirements">15.5.5.2 OAM requirements</h4>
<p>Each NG-RAN node may be configured with <em>alternative coverage

contain relevant radio parameters and may also include a range for how
each parameter is allowed to be adjusted.</p>
<h4 id="dynamic-coverage-configuration-changes">15.5.5.3 Dynamic
coverage configuration changes</h4>
<p>An NG-RAN node may autonomously adjust within and switch between
coverage configurations. When a change is executed, a NG-RAN node may
notify its neighbour NG-RAN nodes using the NG-RAN NODE CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message with the list of cells and SSBs with modified coverage
included. The list contains the CGI of each modified cell with its
coverage state indicator and optionally the SSB index of each modified
SSB with its coverage state indicator.</p>
<p>The coverage state indicator may be used at the receiving NG-RAN node
to adjust the functions of the Mobility Robustness Optimisation, e.g. by
using the coverage state indicator to retrieve a previously stored
Mobility Robustness Optimisation state. The coverage state indicator may
also be used at the receiving NG-RAN node to adopt coverage
configurations matching with neighbouring cells coverage
configurations.</p>
<p>If the list includes indication about planned reconfiguration and
possibly a list of replacing cells, the receiving NG-RAN node may use
this to avoid connection or re-establishment failures during the
reconfiguration. Also, if the sending NG-RAN node adds cells in inactive
state, the receiving NG-RAN node may use this information to avoid
connection or re-establishment failures. The receiving NG-RAN node may
also use the notification to reduce the impact on mobility. The
receiving NG-RAN node should avoid triggering handovers towards cell(s)
that are indicated to be inactive.</p>

<h1 id="verticals-support">16 Verticals Support</h1>
<h2 id="urllc">16.1 URLLC</h2>
<h3 id="overview-7">16.1.1 Overview</h3>
<p>The support of Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC)
services is facilitated by the introduction of the mechanisms described
in the following clauses. Please note however that those mechanisms need
not be limited to the provision of URLLC services. Furthermore, RRC can
associate logical channels with different SR configurations, for
instance, to provide more frequent SR opportunities to URLLC
services.</p>
<h3 id="lcp-restrictions">16.1.2 LCP Restrictions</h3>
<p>With LCP restrictions in MAC, RRC can restrict the mapping of a
logical channel to a subset of the configured cells, numerologies, PUSCH
transmission durations, configured grant configurations and control
whether a logical channel can utilise the resources allocated by a Type
1 Configured Grant (see clause 10.3) or whether a logical channel can
utilise dynamic grants indicating a certain physical priority level.
With such restrictions, it then becomes possible to reserve, for
instance, the numerology with the largest subcarrier spacing and/or
shortest PUSCH transmission duration for URLLC services. Furthermore,
RRC can associate logical channels with different SR configurations, for
instance, to provide more frequent SR opportunities to URLLC
services.</p>
<h3 id="packet-duplication">16.1.3 Packet Duplication</h3>
<p>When duplication is configured for a radio bearer by RRC, at least
one secondary RLC entity is added to the radio bearer to handle the
duplicated PDCP PDUs as depicted on Figure 16.1.3-1, where the logical
channel corresponding to the primary RLC entity is referred to as
<em>the primary logical channel</em>, and the logical channel
corresponding to the secondary RLC entity(ies), the <em>secondary
logical channel(s)</em>. All RLC entities have the same RLC mode.
Duplication at PDCP therefore consists in submitting the same PDCP PDUs
multiple times: once to each activated RLC entity for the radio bearer.
With multiple independent transmission paths, packet duplication
therefore increases reliability and reduces latency and is especially
beneficial for URLLC services.</p>
<p><img src="media/image62.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.1.3-1: Packet Duplication</p>
<p>NOTE: PDCP control PDUs are not duplicated and always submitted to
the primary RLC entity.</p>
<p>When configuring duplication for a DRB, RRC also sets the state of
PDCP duplication (either activated or deactivated) at the time of
(re-)configuration. After the configuration, the PDCP duplication state
can then be dynamically controlled by means of a MAC control element and
in DC, the UE applies the MAC CE commands regardless of their origin
(MCG or SCG). When duplication is configured for an SRB the state is
always active and cannot be dynamically controlled. When configuring
duplication for a DRB with more than one secondary RLC entity, RRC also
sets the state of each of them (i.e. either activated or deactivated).
Subsequently, a MAC CE can be used to dynamically control whether each
of the configured secondary RLC entities for a DRB should be activated
or deactivated, i.e. which of the RLC entities shall be used for
duplicate transmission. Primary RLC entity cannot be deactivated. When
duplication is deactivated for a DRB, all secondary RLC entities
associated to this DRB are deactivated. When a secondary RLC entity is
deactivated, it is not re-established, the HARQ buffers are not flushed,
and the transmitting PDCP entity should indicate to the secondary RLC
entity to discard all duplicated PDCP PDUs.</p>
<p>When activating duplication for a DRB, NG-RAN should ensure that at
least one serving cell is activated for each logical channel associated
with an activated RLC entity of the DRB; and when the deactivation of
SCells leaves no serving cells activated for a logical channel of the
DRB, NG-RAN should ensure that duplication is also deactivated for the
RLC entity associated with the logical channel.</p>
<p>When duplication is activated, the original PDCP PDU and the
corresponding duplicate(s) shall not be transmitted on the same carrier.
The logical channels of a radio bearer configured with duplication can
either belong to the same MAC entity (referred to as CA duplication) or
to different ones (referred to as DC duplication). CA duplication can
also be configured in either or both of the MAC entities together with
DC duplication when duplication over more than two RLC entities is
configured for the radio bearer. In CA duplication, logical channel
mapping restrictions are used in a MAC entity to ensure that the
different logical channels of a radio bearer in the MAC entity are not
sent on the same carrier. When CA duplication is configured for an SRB,
one of the logical channels associated to the SRB is mapped to
SpCell.</p>
<p>When CA duplication is deactivated for a DRB in a MAC entity (i.e.
none or only one of RLC entities of the DRB in the MAC entity remains
activated), the logical channel mapping restrictions of the logical
channels of the DRB are lifted for as long as CA duplication remains
deactivated for the DRB in the MAC entity.</p>
<p>When an RLC entity acknowledges the transmission of a PDCP PDU, the
PDCP entity shall indicate to the other RLC entity(ies) to discard it.
In addition, in case of CA duplication, when an RLC entity restricted to
only SCell(s) reaches the maximum number of retransmissions for a PDCP
PDU, the UE informs the gNB but does not trigger RLF.</p>
<h3 id="cqi-and-mcs">16.1.4 CQI and MCS</h3>
<p>For channel state reporting, a CQI table for target block error rate
10<sup>-5</sup> is introduced.</p>
<p>For scheduling data packets with higher reliability, 64QAM MCS tables
containing entries with lower spectral efficiency are introduced for
both downlink and uplink. The tables are different for CP-OFDM and
DFT-s-OFDM. The MCS tables can be configured semi-statically or
dynamically. The dynamic signalling of MCS table is supported by
configuring UE with MCS-C-RNTI, where the scrambling of DCI CRC by
MCS-C-RNTI indicates the 64QAM MCS tables with entries of lower spectral
efficiency.</p>
<h3 id="dci-formats">16.1.5 DCI formats</h3>

Redundant user plane paths based on dual connectivity</h4>
<p>UE may initiate two redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network. The
5GS sets up the user plane paths of the two redundant PDU sessions to be
disjoint. When PDU session setup or modification is initiated, the RAN
can configure dual connectivity in one NG-RAN node or two NG-RAN nodes
for the two redundant PDU sessions to ensure the disjoint user plane
paths according to the redundancy information received from the 5GC. The
RAN shall ensure that the resources of the data radio bearers for the
two redundant PDU sessions are isolated. If the RAN cannot satisfy the
disjoint user plane requirement, the redundant PDU sessions may be kept
or not kept according to the RAN local configuration. The redundancy
information is transferred to the target NG-RAN node in case of
handover.</p>
<h4

<p>Two NG-U tunnels are setup between single UPF and single NG-RAN node
for redundant transmission of the QoS flows when PDU session setup or
modification is initiated. The two NG-U tunnels are transferred via
disjointed transport layer paths. The 5GC provides the indicator per QoS
flow to the NG-RAN for the redundant transmission. For downlink, the
NG-RAN node eliminates the duplicated packets per QoS flow. For uplink,
the NG-RAN node replicates the packets and transmits them via the two
NG-U tunnels. The indicator per QoS flow for redundant transmission is
transferred to the target NG-RAN node in case of handover.</p>
<h3 id="urllc-in-unlicensed-controlled-environment">16.1.7 URLLC in

<p>URLLC services can be supported in shared spectrum where LBT failures
are assumed to be not frequent. In this case, a channel access procedure
for semi-static channel occupancy can be initiated by the gNB or the UE,
or the gNB operates in dynamic channel access mode, as described in TS
37.213 [37]. To handle potential LBT failures on configured grants (CG),
the CG retransmission timer can be optionally configured to enable
autonomous retransmissions, and it may be configured simultaneously with
enhanced intra-UE overlapping resource prioritization mechanisms. When
the CG retransmission timer is configured, the UE shall select the HARQ
process for each CG resource by itself. If the enhanced intra-UE
overlapping resource prioritization mechanisms is also configured, the
UE may be further configured to select the HARQ process for a CG
resource based on logical channel priority.</p>
<h3 id="pucch-cell-switching-for-tdd-cells">16.1.8 PUCCH cell switching

sSCell) that can be used for PUCCH transmission in addition to PCell /
PSCell / PUCCH SCell. The applicable cell for PUCCH transmission to be
either on PCell /PSCell / PUCCH SCell or the PUCCH sSCell at a time is
either defined by:</p>

<p>RAN-assisted codec adaptation provides a means for the gNB to send

to select or adapt to a codec rate for MMTEL voice or MMTEL video. The
RAN-assisted codec adaptation mechanism supports the uplink/downlink bit
rate increase or decrease. For a bearer associated with configuration of
MBR greater than GBR, the recommended uplink/downlink bit rate is within
boundaries set by the MBR and GBR of the concerned bearer.</p>
<p>For uplink or downlink bit rate adaptation, gNB may send a
recommended bit rate to the UE to inform the UE on the currently
recommended transport bit rate on the local uplink or downlink, which
the UE may use in combination with other information to adapt the bit
rate, e.g. the UE may send a bit rate request to the peer UE via
application layer messages as specified in TS 26.114 [24], which the
peer UE may use in combination with other information to adapt the codec
bit rate. The recommended bit rate is in kbps at the physical layer at
the time when the decision is made.</p>
<p>The recommended bit rate for UL and DL is conveyed as a MAC Control
Element (CE) from the gNB to the UE as outlined in Figure

<p><img src="media/image63.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.2.1.1-1: UL or DL bit rate recommendation</p>
<p>Based on the recommended bit rate from the gNB, a UE may initiate an
end-to-end bit rate adaptation with its peer (UE or MGW). The UE may
also send a query message to its local gNB to check if a bit rate
recommended by its peer can be provided by the gNB. The UE is not
expected to go beyond the recommended bit rate from the gNB.</p>
<p>The recommended bit rate query message is conveyed as a MAC CE from
the UE to the gNB as outlined in Figure 16.2.1.1-2.</p>

may be achieved when a UE in good coverage indicates a preference to the
gNB to reduce the local air interface delay by sending a
<em>DelayBudgetReport</em> message to decrease the DRX cycle length, so
that the E2E delay and jitter can be reduced. When the UE detects
changes such as end-to-end MMTEL voice quality or local radio quality,
the UE may inform the gNB its new preference by sending

<p>A network slice always consists of a RAN part and a CN part. The
support of network slicing relies on the principle that traffic for
different slices is handled by different PDU sessions. Network can
realise the different network slices by scheduling and also by providing
different L1/L2 configurations.</p>
<p>Each network slice is uniquely identified by a S-NSSAI, as defined in

includes one or a list of S-NSSAIs (Single NSSAI) where a S-NSSAI is a
combination of:</p>
<p>- mandatory SST (Slice/Service Type) field, which identifies the
slice type and consists of 8 bits (with range is 0-255);</p>
<p>- optional SD (Slice Differentiator) field, which differentiates
among Slices with same SST field and consist of 24 bits.</p>
<p>The list includes at most 8 S-NSSAI(s).</p>
<p>The UE provides NSSAI (Network Slice Selection Assistance
Information) for network slice selection in <em>RRCSetupComplete</em>,
if it has been provided by NAS (see clause 9.2.1.3). While the network
can support large number of slices (hundreds), the UE need not support
more than 8 slices simultaneously. A BL UE or a NB-IoT UE supports a
maximum of 8 slices simultaneously.</p>
<p>Network Slicing is a concept to allow differentiated treatment
depending on each customer requirements. With slicing, it is possible
for Mobile Network Operators (MNO) to consider customers as belonging to
different tenant types with each having different service requirements
that govern in terms of what slice types each tenant is eligible to use
based on Service Level Agreement (SLA) and subscriptions.</p>
<p>The following key principles apply for support of Network Slicing in
NG-RAN:</p>
<p><strong>RAN awareness of slices</strong></p>
<p>- NG-RAN supports a differentiated handling of traffic for different
network slices which have been pre-configured. How NG-RAN supports the
slice enabling in terms of NG-RAN functions (i.e. the set of network
functions that comprise each slice) is implementation dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Selection of RAN part of the network slice</strong></p>
<p>- NG-RAN supports the selection of the RAN part of the network slice,
by NSSAI provided by the UE or the 5GC which unambiguously identifies
one or more of the pre-configured network slices in the PLMN.</p>
<p><strong>Resource management between slices</strong></p>
<p>- NG-RAN supports policy enforcement between slices as per service
level agreements. It should be possible for a single NG-RAN node to
support multiple slices. The NG-RAN should be free to apply the best RRM
policy for the SLA in place to each supported slice.</p>
<p><strong>Support of QoS</strong></p>
<p>- NG-RAN supports QoS differentiation within a slice, and per
Slice-Maximum Bit Rate may be enforced per UE, if feasible. How NG-RAN
enables UE-Slice-MBR enforcement and rate limitation (see TS 23.501 [3])
is up to network implementation.</p>
<p><strong>RAN selection of CN entity</strong></p>
<p>- For initial attach, the UE may provide NSSAI to support the
selection of an AMF. If available, NG-RAN uses this information for
routing the initial NAS to an AMF. If the NG-RAN is unable to select an
AMF using this information or the UE does not provide any such
information the NG-RAN sends the NAS signalling to one of the default
AMFs.</p>
<p>- For subsequent accesses, the UE provides a Temp ID, which is
assigned to the UE by the 5GC, to enable the NG-RAN to route the NAS
message to the appropriate AMF as long as the Temp ID is valid (NG-RAN
is aware of and can reach the AMF which is associated with the Temp ID).
Otherwise, the methods for initial attach applies.</p>
<p><strong>Resource isolation between slices</strong></p>
<p>- The NG-RAN supports resource isolation between slices. NG-RAN
resource isolation may be achieved by means of RRM policies and
protection mechanisms that should avoid that shortage of shared
resources in one slice breaks the service level agreement for another
slice. It should be possible to fully dedicate NG-RAN resources to a
certain slice. Some RACH resources can be associated to specific
NSAG(s). Other aspects how NG-RAN supports resource isolation is
implementation dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Access control</strong></p>
<p>- By means of the unified access control (see clause 7.4),
operator-defined access categories can be used to enable differentiated
handling for different slices. NG-RAN may broadcast barring control
information (i.e. a list of barring parameters associated with
operator-defined access categories) to minimize the impact of congested
slices.</p>
<p><strong>Slice Availability</strong></p>
<p>- Some slices may be available only in part of the network. The
NG-RAN supported S-NSSAI(s), NSAG(s) and NSAG related information such
as NSAG associated Cell Reselection Priority and/or NSAG associated RACH
resources are configured by OAM. Awareness in the NG-RAN of the slices
supported in the cells of its neighbours may be beneficial for
inter-frequency mobility in connected mode. In order to support the
NSAG, the NG-RAN provides the AMF with the NSAG information per TA in
the appropriate NG interface management procedures, as specified in TS
38.413 [26]. Awareness in the NG-RAN of the NSAG information supported
in the list(s) of neighbour cells may be configured by OAM, or exchanged
with neighbour NG-RAN nodes.It is assumed that the slice availability
does not change within the UE's registration area (see TS 23.501
[3]).</p>
<p>- The NG-RAN and the 5GC are responsible to handle a service request
for a slice that may or may not be available in a given area. Admission
or rejection of access to a slice may depend by factors such as support
for the slice, availability of resources, support of the requested
service by NG-RAN.</p>
<p><strong>Support for UE associating with multiple network slices
simultaneously</strong></p>
<p>- In case a UE is associated with multiple slices simultaneously,
only one signalling connection is maintained and for intra-frequency
cell reselection, the UE always tries to camp on the best cell. For
inter-frequency cell reselection, dedicated priorities can be used to
control the frequency on which the UE camps.</p>
<p><strong>Granularity of slice awareness</strong></p>
<p>- Slice awareness in NG-RAN is introduced at PDU session level, by
indicating the S-NSSAI corresponding to the PDU Session, in all
signalling containing PDU session resource information.</p>
<p><strong>Validation of the UE rights to access a network
slice</strong></p>
<p>- It is the responsibility of the 5GC to validate that the UE has the
rights to access a network slice. Prior to receiving the Initial Context
Setup Request message, the NG-RAN may be allowed to apply some
provisional/local policies, based on awareness of which slice the UE is
requesting access to. During the initial context setup, the NG-RAN is
informed of the slice for which resources are being requested.</p>

<p>To enable differentiated handling of traffic for network slices with
different SLA:</p>
<p>- NG-RAN is configured with a set of different configurations for
different network slices by OAM;</p>
<p>- To select the appropriate configuration for the traffic for each
network slice, NG-RAN receives relevant information indicating which of
the configurations applies for this specific network slice.</p>
<p>Slice-based RACH configuration for RA isolation and prioritization
can be included in SIB1 messages. The slice-based RACH configurations
are associated to specific NSAG(s), and if not provided for a NSAG that
UE considers for selecting the RACH configuration, then the UE does not
consider the NSAG for selecting the slice-based RACH configuration. The
UE determines the NSAG to be considered during RA as specified in TS
23.501 [3]. When the UE AS does not receive any NSAG information from
NAS for Random Access, the UE does not apply the slice-based RACH
configuration.</p>
<h4 id="handling-of-slice-resources">16.3.3.2 Handling of Slice

<p>The NG-RAN node may use Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing or Resource

described in 16.3.4 to support the slice service continuity in case of
slice resources shortage.</p>
<p>In Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing the RAN node can setup the dual
connectivity or carrier aggregation with different frequency and
overlapping coverage where the same slice is available.</p>
<p>The Resource Repartitioning allows a slice to use resources from the
shared pool or/and prioritized pool when its own dedicated or
prioritized resources are not available and the use of unused resources
in the prioritized pool is as specified in TS 28.541 [49].</p>
<p>Slice RRM policies/restrictions associated with Resource
Repartitioning are configured from O&amp;M.</p>
<p>Measurements of RRM policy utilization according to resource types
defined in TS 28.541 [49] are reported from RAN nodes to O&amp;M and may

policies/restrictions.</p>
<h3 id="a-slice-based-cell-reselection">16.3.3a Slice-based cell
reselection</h3>
<p>Slice-based cell reselection information can be included in SIB16 and
in <em>RRCRelease</em> messages. The slice-based cell reselection
information may include reselection priorities per NSAG per frequency
and corresponding list(s) of cells where the slices of the NSAG are
supported or not supported. The UE determines the NSAG(s) and their
priorities to be considered during cell reselection as specified in TS
23.501 [3], and in TS 38.304 [10].</p>
<p>When a UE supports slice-based cell reselection, and when slice-based
cell reselection information is provided to the UE, then the UE uses the
slice-based cell reselection information. Valid cell reselection
information provided in <em>RRCRelease</em> always has a priority over
cell reselection information provided in SIB messages. When no
slice-based cell reselection information is provided for any NSAG that
was determined to be considered during cell reselection (as specified in
TS 23.501 [3]), then the UE uses the general cell reselection
information, i.e., without considering the NSAG(s) and their
priorities.</p>

<p>Figure 16.3.4.2-1: AMF selection</p>
<p>In case a Temp ID is not available, the NG-RAN uses the NSSAI
provided by the UE at RRC connection establishment to select the
appropriate AMF (the information is provided after MSG3 of the random
access procedure). If such information is also not available, the NG-RAN
routes the UE to one of the configured default AMF(s).</p>
<p>The NG-RAN uses the list of supported S-NSSAI(s) previously received

<h4 id="ue-context-handling">16.3.4.3 UE Context Handling</h4>
<p>Following the initial access, the establishment of the RRC connection
and the selection of the correct AMF, the AMF establishes the complete
UE context by sending the Initial Context Setup Request message to the
NG-RAN over NG-C. The message contains the Allowed NSSAI and
additionally contains the S-NSSAI(s) as part of the PDU session(s)
resource description when present in the message. Upon successful
establishment of the UE context and allocation of PDU session resources
to the relevant network slice(s) when present, the NG-RAN responds with
the Initial Context Setup Response message.</p>

<p>When new PDU sessions need to be established, the 5GC requests the
NG-RAN to allocate/ resources relative to the relevant PDU sessions by
means of the PDU Session Resource Setup procedures over NG-C. One
S-NSSAI is added per PDU session to be established, so NG-RAN is enabled
to apply policies at PDU session level according to the SLA represented
by the network slice, while still being able to apply (for example)
differentiated QoS within the slice.</p>
<p>NG-RAN confirms the establishment of the resources for a PDU session
associated to a certain network slice by responding with the PDU Session
Resource Setup Response message over the NG-C interface.</p>

<h4 id="mobility">16.3.4.5 Mobility</h4>
<p>To make mobility slice-aware in case of Network Slicing, S-NSSAI is

congestion control.</p>
<p>Both NG and Xn handovers are allowed regardless of the slice support
of the target NG-RAN node i.e. even if the target NG-RAN node does not
support the same slices as the source NG-RAN node. An example for the

<h2 id="public-warning-system">16.4 Public Warning System</h2>
<p>NR connected to 5GC provides support for public warning systems (PWS)
through means of system information broadcast capability. NR is
responsible for scheduling and broadcasting of the warning messages as
well as for paging the UE to provide indication that the warning message
is being broadcast:</p>
<p>- Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System: ETWS is a public warning
system developed to meet the regulatory requirements for warning
notifications related to earthquake and/or tsunami events (see TS 22.168
[14]). ETWS warning notifications can either be a primary notification
(short notification) or secondary notification (providing detailed
information).</p>
<p>- Commercial Mobile Alert System: CMAS is a public warning system
developed for the delivery of multiple, concurrent warning notifications
(see TS 22.268 [15]).</p>
<p>Different SIBs are defined for ETWS primary notification, ETWS
secondary notification and CMAS notification. Paging is used to inform
UEs about ETWS indication and CMAS indication (see clause 9.2.5). UE
monitors ETWS/CMAS indication in its own paging occasion for RRC_IDLE
and for RRC_INACTIVE while no SDT procedure (see clause 18.0) is
ongoing. UE monitors ETWS/CMAS indication in any paging occasion for RRC
Connected and during the SDT procedure in RRC_INACTIVE. Paging
indicating ETWS/CMAS notification triggers acquisition of system
information (without delaying until the next modification period).</p>
<p>Enhancements of public warning system (ePWS) enable broadcast of
language-independent content and notifications to UEs with no user
interface or with a user interface that is incapable of displaying text,
see clause 9 in TS 22.268 [15] and TS 23.041 [54]. ETWS/CMAS
notifications with ePWS functionality use the same AS mechanisms as
ETWS/CMAS.</p>
<p>KPAS and EU-Alert are public warning systems developed for the
delivery of multiple, concurrent warning notifications (see TS 22.268
[15]). KPAS and EU-Alert uses the same AS mechanisms as CMAS. Therefore,
the NR procedures defined for CMAS equally apply for KPAS and
EU-Alert.</p>
<h2 id="emergency-services">16.5 Emergency Services</h2>
<h3 id="overview-8">16.5.1 Overview</h3>
<p>NG-RAN provides support for Emergency Services either directly or
through fallback mechanisms towards E-UTRA. The support of Emergency
Services is broadcast in system information (see TS 38.331 [12]).</p>
<h3 id="ims-emergency-call">16.5.2 IMS Emergency call</h3>
<p>An IMS Emergency call support indication is provided to inform the UE
that emergency bearer services are supported. In normal service state
the UE is informed if the PLMN supports emergency services through an
Emergency Service Support indicator in the Attach and TAU procedures
(see TS 23.501 [3]). In limited service state and for emergency services
other than eCall over IMS, a UE is informed about if a cell supports
emergency services over NG-RAN from a broadcast indication
(<em>ims-EmergencySupport</em>). The broadcast indicator is set to
"support" if any AMF in a non-shared environment or at least one of the
PLMN's in a shared environment supports IMS emergency bearer
services.</p>
<h3 id="ecall-over-ims">16.5.3 eCall over IMS</h3>
<p>NG-RAN broadcast an indication to indicate support of eCall over IMS
(<em>eCallOverIMS-Support</em>). UEs that are in limited service state
need to consider both <em>eCallOverIMS-Support</em> and
<em>ims-EmergencySupport</em> to determine if eCall over IMS is
possible. UEs that are not in limited service state need to only
consider <em>eCallOverIMS-Support</em> to determine if eCall over IMS is
possible. The broadcast indicator is set to "support" if the PLMN in a
non-shared environment, or all PLMNs in a shared environment, supports
eCall over IMS.</p>
<h3 id="fallback">16.5.4 Fallback</h3>
<p>RAT fallback towards E-UTRA connected to 5GC is performed when NR
does not support Emergency Services and System fallback towards E-UTRA
connected to EPS is performed when 5GC does not support Emergency
Services. Depending on factors such as CN interface availability,
network configuration and radio conditions, the fallback procedure
results in either CONNECTED state mobility (handover procedure) or IDLE
state mobility (redirection) - see TS 23.501 [3] and TS 38.331 [12].</p>
<h2 id="stand-alone-npn">16.6 Stand-Alone NPN</h2>
<h3 id="general-10">16.6.1 General</h3>
<p>An SNPN is a network deployed for non-public use which does not rely
on network functions provided by a PLMN (see clause 4.8). An SNPN is
identified by a PLMN ID and NID (see clause 8.2) broadcast in SIB1.</p>
<p>An SNPN-capable UE supports the SNPN access mode. When the UE is set
to operate in SNPN access mode, the UE only selects and registers with
SNPNs. When the UE is not set to operate in SNPN access mode, the UE
performs normal PLMN selection procedures.</p>
<p>Emergency services and ETWS /CMAS can be supported by SNPNs. An IMS
Emergency call support indication is provided per SNPN to inform the UE
which SNPN(s) support emergency bearer. In normal service state the
indication is provided in the same way as in case of PLMNs (see clause
16.5.2). In limited service state and for emergency services other than
eCall over IMS, a UE is informed whether an SNPN of the cell supports
emergency services over NG-RAN from a per SNPN broadcast indication
(<em>imsEmergencySupportForSNPN</em>). The broadcast indicator for an
SNPN may be set to "support" if any AMF of the SNPN supports IMS
emergency bearer services.</p>

<h4 id="connected-mode">16.6.2.3 Connected Mode</h4>
<p>The NG-RAN node is aware of the SNPN ID(s) supported by neighbour
cells.</p>
<p>At the time of handover, cells that do not support the serving SNPN
ID are not considered as candidate target cells by the source NG-RAN
node.</p>
<p>The target NG-RAN node performs access control. In case it cannot
accept the handover for the serving SNPN the target NG-RAN node fails
the handover including an appropriate cause value.</p>
<p>16.6.3 Self-Configuration for SNPN</p>
<p>Self-configuration is described in clause 15. In addition, on NG, the
NG-RAN node signals the SNPN ID(s) supported per tracking area and the
AMF signals the SNPN ID(s) supported per node; on Xn, NG-RAN nodes
exchange SNPN ID(s) supported per cell.</p>
<p>16.6.4 Access Control</p>
<p>During the establishment of the UE-associated logical NG-connection
towards the 5GC, the AMF checks whether the UE is allowed to access the
cell for the signalled SNPN ID as specified in TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<p>If the check is successful, the AMF sets up the UE-associated logical
NG-connection and provides the NG-RAN node with the mobility
restrictions applicable for the SNPN.</p>
<p>If the check is not successful, the AMF shall reject setting up the
UE-associated NG connection and inform the NG-RAN node with an
appropriate cause value as specified in TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<p>16.6.5 Access with subscription/credentials owned by a Credentials
Holder</p>
<p>An SNPN may allow access to UEs being authorized using credentials or
subscription owned by a separate Credentials Holder (CH). The support of
this feature is uniform across the SNPN as specified in TS 23.501
[3].</p>
<p>The following information is broadcast to support SNPN access with
subscription of a Credentials Holder:</p>
<p>- an indication per SNPN in SIB1 that access using credentials from a
Credentials Holder is supported;</p>
<p>- optionally a list of supported GINs in SIB18 (each GIN may be
assigned to one or more SNPNs);</p>
<p>- an optional indication per SNPN in SIB1 that the SNPN allows
registration attempts from UEs that are not explicitly configured to
select the SNPN.</p>
<p>The above listed items are forwarded to the UE NAS layer that uses
them for SNPN selection.</p>
<p>16.6.6 Support of UE onboarding and remote provisioning</p>
<p>An SNPN may offer support for restricted 3GPP connectivity for remote
provisioning of credentials. The feature is enabled/disabled per

<p>The following information is broadcast to support UE onboarding and
remote provisioning:</p>
<p>- an indication per onboarding SNPN in SIB1 that UE onboarding is
enabled;</p>
<p>- optionally a list of supported GINs in SIB18 (each GIN may be
assigned to one or more onboarding SNPNs).</p>
<p>The above listed items are forwarded to the UE NAS layer that uses
them for onboarding SNPN selection. When a UE intends to perform
onboarding, it sends the onboarding request indication to the gNB during
RRC connection establishment.</p>
<p>The NG-RAN nodes receive information about onboarding support
capabilities of the AMF(s). This information is used by the NG-RAN node
to select a suitable AMF when receiving the onboarding request
indication from the UE.</p>

autonomous search function, which determines itself when/where to
search, but cannot contradict the dedicated cell reselection priority
information if any is stored.</p>
<p>A range of PCI values reserved by the network for use by CAG cells
may be broadcast.</p>
<p>A CAG Member Cell for a UE is a cell broadcasting the identity of the
selected PLMN, registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN, and for that PLMN, a
CAG identifier belonging to the Allowed CAG list of the UE for that
PLMN. The UE checks the suitability of CAG cells based on the Allowed
CAG list provided by upper layers and a CAG-only cell can only be
suitable for its subscribers but can be acceptable for the rest.</p>
<p>NOTE: A non-CAG-capable UE (e.g. Rel-15 UE) considers a CAG-only cell
as acceptable cell if the cell is not barred to Rel-15 UEs, and if
a PLMN ID without CAG list is broadcast and that PLMN is forbidden (e.g.
by use of a PLMN ID for which all registration attempts are rejected
such that the PLMN ID becomes forbidden).</p>
<p>When the UE is configured with a CAG-only indication, only CAG Member
Cells can be suitable. A non-suitable cell can be acceptable though if
the UE is configured with a CAG-only indication for one of the PLMN
broadcast by the cell.</p>
<p>In addition, manual selection of CAG cell(s) is supported, for which

<p>Self-configuration is described in clause 15.</p>
<p>In addition, each NG-RAN node informs the connected neighbour NG-RAN

<h3 id="access-control-1">16.7.4 Access Control</h3>
<p>During the establishment of the UE-associated logical NG-connection
towards the 5GC, the AMF checks whether the UE is allowed to access the
cell as specified in TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<p>If the check is successful, the AMF sets up the UE-associated logical
NG-connection and provides the NG-RAN node with the list of CAGs allowed
for the UE and, whether the UE is allowed to access non-CAG cells. This
information is used by the NG-RAN for access control of subsequent
mobility.</p>
<p>If the check is not successful, the AMF shall reject setting up the
UE-associated NG connection and inform the NG-RAN node with an
appropriate cause value as specified in TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<h3 id="paging-1">16.7.5 Paging</h3>
<p>The NG-RAN node may receive a paging message including the list of
CAGs allowed for the UE, and whether the UE is allowed to access non-CAG
cells. The NG-RAN node may use this information to avoid paging in cells
on which the UE is not allowed to camp.</p>
<p>For UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state, the NG-RAN node may page a neighbour
NG-RAN node including the list of CAGs allowed for the UE, and whether
the UE is allowed to access non-CAG cells. The neighbour NG-RAN node may
use this information to avoid paging in cells on which the UE is not
allowed to camp.</p>
<h2 id="support-for-time-sensitive-communications">16.8 Support for Time
Sensitive Communications</h2>
<p>Time Sensitive Communications (TSC), as defined in TS 23.501 [3], is
a communication service that supports deterministic communication and/or
isochronous communication with high reliability and availability.
Examples of such services are the ones in the area of Industrial
Internet of Things, e.g. related to cyber-physical control applications
as described in TS 22.104 [39].</p>
<p>To support strict synchronization accuracy requirements of TSC
applications, the gNB may signal 5G system time reference information to
the UE using unicast or broadcast RRC signalling with a granularity of
10 ns. Uncertainty parameter may be included in reference time
information to indicate its accuracy. The UE may indicate to the gNB a
preference to be provisioned with reference time information using UE
Assistance Information procedure. Propagation delay compensation (PDC)
mechanisms may be applied based on RTT or TA, and can be performed at
the UE or gNB side. When performed at UE side, the PDC mechanisms are
controlled via RRC signalling by the gNB.</p>
<p>The RTT-based PDC mechanism is achieved by using Rx-Tx time
difference measurements of a single pair of configured TRS/PRS and SRS.
The following figure describes the signalling procedures of UE-side
RTT-based PDC:</p>
<p><img src="media/image70.svg" /></p>

measurements;</p>

UE;</p>

from itself and the gNB.</p>
<p>The following figure describes the signalling procedures of gNB-side
RTT-based PDC:</p>

measurements;</p>
<p>4. The UE reports its Rx-Tx time difference measurement to the
gNB;</p>
<p>5. The gNB performs PDC based on Rx-Tx time difference measurements
from itself and the UE.</p>
<p>The gNB may also receive TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI), see TS
23.501 [3], from the Core Network, e.g. during QoS flow establishment,
or from another gNB during handover. TSCAI contains additional
information about the traffic flow such as burst arrival time, burst
periodicity, and survival time. TSCAI knowledge may be leveraged in the
gNB's scheduler to more efficiently schedule periodic, deterministic
traffic flows either via Configured Grants, Semi-Persistent Scheduling
or with dynamic grants, and/or to improve the associated link
reliability to meet the survival time requirement (see TS 22.104
[39]).</p>
<p>To support uplink periodic traffics of services with survival time
requirement, configured grant resources can be used such that the
mapping relation between the service and the configured grant is known
to both gNB and UE, thus allowing the gNB to use configured grant
retransmission scheduling (addressed by CS-RNTI) to trigger survival
time state entry for the corresponding DRB. Upon survival time state
entry, all RLC entities configured for the DRB are activated by the UE
for duplication to prevent failure of subsequent messages and hence
fulfilling the survival time requirement. If CA or DC duplication for
the DRB is already activated, the DRB should enter survival time state
when any retransmission grant for any of its active LCHs is
received.</p>

<p>The NG-RAN architecture supports the PC5 interface as illustrated in
Figure 16.9.1-1. Sidelink transmission and reception over the PC5
interface are supported when the UE is inside NG-RAN coverage,
irrespective of which RRC state the UE is in, and when the UE is outside
NG-RAN coverage.</p>

Radio Protocol Architecture for NR sidelink communication</h3>
<h4 id="overview-9">16.9.2.1 Overview</h4>
<p>The AS protocol stack for the control plane for SCCH for RRC in the
PC5 interface consists of RRC, PDCP, RLC and MAC sublayers, and the
physical layer. The protocol stack of control plane for SCCH for RRC is
shown in Figure 16.9.2.1-1.</p>
<p><img src="media/image73.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.9.2.1-1: Control plane protocol stack for SCCH for RRC.</p>
<p>For support of PC5-S protocol specified in TS 23.287 [40], PC5-S is
located on top of PDCP, RLC and MAC sublayers, and the physical layer in
the control plane protocol stack for SCCH for PC5-S, as shown in Figure
16.9.2.1-2.</p>
<p><img src="media/image74.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.9.2.1-2: Control plane protocol stack for SCCH for

<p><img src="media/image75.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.9.2.1-3: Control plane protocol stack for SBCCH.</p>

<p><img src="media/image76.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.9.2.1-4: User plane protocol stack for STCH.</p>
<p>Sidelink Radio bearers (SLRB) are categorized into two groups:
sidelink data radio bearers (SL DRB) for user plane data and sidelink
signalling radio bearers (SL SRB) for control plane data. Separate SL
SRBs using different SCCHs are configured for PC5-RRC and PC5-S
signalling respectively.</p>
<h4 id="mac">16.9.2.2 MAC</h4>
<p>The MAC sublayer provides the following services and functions over
the PC5 interface in addition to the services and functions specified in
clause 6.2.1:</p>
<p>- Radio resource selection;</p>
<p>- Packet filtering;</p>
<p>- Priority handling between uplink and sidelink transmissions for a
given UE;</p>
<p>- Sidelink CSI reporting.</p>
<p>With LCP restrictions in MAC, only sidelink logical channels
belonging to the same destination can be multiplexed into a MAC PDU for
every unicast, groupcast and broadcast transmission which is associated
to the destination. NG-RAN can also control whether a sidelink logical
channel can utilise the resources allocated to a configured sidelink
grant Type 1 (see clause 16.9.3.2). For transmissions to RX UE(s) using
SL DRX operation, LCP ensures that a TX UE transmits data in the active
time of the RX UE(s).</p>
<p>For packet filtering, a SL-SCH MAC header including portions of both
Source Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID is added to each MAC PDU
as specified in clause 8.4. LCID included within a MAC subheader
uniquely identifies a logical channel within the scope of the Source
Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID combination.</p>
<p>The following logical channels are used in sidelink:</p>
<p>- Sidelink Control Channel (SCCH): a sidelink channel for
transmitting control information (i.e. PC5-RRC and PC5-S messages) and
NR sidelink discovery messages from one UE to other UE(s);</p>
<p>- Sidelink Traffic Channel (STCH): a sidelink channel for
transmitting user information from one UE to other UE(s);</p>
<p>- Sidelink Broadcast Control Channel (SBCCH): a sidelink channel for
broadcasting sidelink system information from one UE to other UE(s).</p>
<p>The following connections between logical channels and transport
channels exist:</p>
<p>- SCCH can be mapped to SL-SCH;</p>
<p>- STCH can be mapped to SL-SCH;</p>
<p>- SBCCH can be mapped to SL-BCH.</p>
<h4 id="rlc">16.9.2.3 RLC</h4>
<p>The services and functions of the RLC sublayer as specified in clause
6.3.2 are supported for sidelink. TM is used for SBCCH. Both UM and AM
are used in unicast transmission while only UM is used in groupcast or
broadcast transmission. For UM, only unidirectional transmission is
supported for groupcast and broadcast.</p>
<h4 id="pdcp">16.9.2.4 PDCP</h4>
<p>The services and functions of the PDCP sublayer as specified in
clause 6.4.1 are supported for sidelink with some restrictions:</p>
<p>- Out-of-order delivery is supported only for unicast
transmission;</p>
<p>- Duplication is not supported over the PC5 interface.</p>
<h4 id="sdap">16.9.2.5 SDAP</h4>
<p>The SDAP sublayer provides the following service and function over
the PC5 interface:</p>
<p>- Mapping between a QoS flow and a sidelink data radio bearer.</p>
<p>There is one SDAP entity per destination for one of unicast,
groupcast and broadcast which is associated to the destination.
Reflective QoS is not supported over the PC5 interface.</p>
<h4 id="rrc-1">16.9.2.6 RRC</h4>
<p>The RRC sublayer provides the following services and functions over
the PC5 interface:</p>
<p>- Transfer of a PC5-RRC message between peer UEs;</p>
<p>- Maintenance and release of a PC5-RRC connection between two
UEs;</p>
<p>- Detection of sidelink radio link failure for a PC5-RRC
connection;</p>
<p>- Measurement configuration and reporting related to sidelink.</p>
<p>A PC5-RRC connection is a logical connection between two UEs for a
pair of Source and Destination Layer-2 IDs which is considered to be
established after a corresponding PC5 unicast link is established as
specified in TS 23.287 [40]. There is one-to-one correspondence between
the PC5-RRC connection and the PC5 unicast link. A UE may have multiple
PC5-RRC connections with one or more UEs for different pairs of Source
and Destination Layer-2 IDs.</p>
<p>Separate PC5-RRC procedures and messages are used for a UE to
transfer UE capability and sidelink configuration to the peer UE, as
specified in TS 38.331 [3]. Both peer UEs can exchange their own UE
capability and sidelink configuration using separate bi-directional
procedures in both sidelink directions.</p>
<p>If it is not interested in sidelink transmission, if sidelink RLF on
the PC5-RRC connection is declared, or if the Layer-2 link release
procedure is completed as specified in TS 23.287 [40], UE releases the
PC5-RRC connection.</p>
<h3 id="radio-resource-allocation">16.9.3 Radio Resource Allocation</h3>
<h4 id="general-15">16.9.3.1 General</h4>
<p>For NR sidelink communication, the UE can operate in two modes as
specified in 5.7.2 for resource allocation in sidelink:</p>
<p>- Scheduled resource allocation, characterized by:</p>
<p>- The UE needs to be RRC_CONNECTED in order to transmit data;</p>
<p>- NG-RAN schedules transmission resources.</p>
<p>- UE autonomous resource selection, characterized by:</p>
<p>- The UE can transmit data when inside NG-RAN coverage, irrespective
of which RRC state the UE is in, and when outside NG-RAN coverage;</p>
<p>- The UE autonomously selects transmission resources from resource
pool(s).</p>
<p>For NR sidelink communication, the UE performs sidelink transmissions
only on a single carrier.</p>
<h4 id="scheduled-resource-allocation">16.9.3.2 Scheduled Resource
Allocation</h4>
<p>NG-RAN can dynamically allocate resources to the UE via the SL-RNTI
on PDCCH(s) for NR sidelink communication.</p>
<p>In addition, NG-RAN can allocate sidelink resources to a UE with two
types of configured sidelink grants:</p>
<p>- With type 1, RRC directly provides the configured sidelink grant
only for NR sidelink communication;</p>
<p>- With type 2, RRC defines the periodicity of the configured sidelink
grant while PDCCH can either signal and activate the configured sidelink
grant, or deactivate it. The PDCCH is addressed to SL-CS-RNTI for NR
sidelink communication.</p>
<p>Besides, NG-RAN can also semi-persistently allocate sidelink
resources to the UE via the SL Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI on
PDCCH(s) for V2X sidelink communication.</p>
<p>For the UE performing NR sidelink communication, there can be more
than one configured sidelink grant activated at a time on the carrier
configured for sidelink transmission.</p>
<p>When beam failure or physical layer problem occurs on MCG, the UE can
continue using the configured sidelink grant Type 1 until initiation of
the RRC connection re-establishment procedure as specified in TS 38.331
[12]. During handover, the UE can be provided with configured sidelink
grants via handover command, regardless of the type. If provided, the UE
activates the configured sidelink grant Type 1 upon reception of the
handover command or execution of CHO.</p>
<p>The UE can send sidelink buffer status report to support scheduler
operation in NG-RAN. For NR sidelink communication, the sidelink buffer
status reports refer to the data that is buffered in for a group of
logical channels (LCG) per destination in the UE. Eight LCGs are used
for reporting of the sidelink buffer status reports. Two formats, which
are SL BSR and truncated SL BSR, are used.</p>
<h4 id="ue-autonomous-resource-selection">16.9.3.3 UE Autonomous
Resource Selection</h4>
<p>The UE autonomously selects sidelink resource(s) from resource
pool(s) provided by broadcast system information or dedicated signalling
while inside NG-RAN coverage or by pre-configuration while outside
NG-RAN coverage.</p>
<p>For NR sidelink communication, the resource pool(s) can be provided
for a given validity area where the UE does not need to acquire a new
pool of resources while moving within the validity area, at least when
this pool is provided by SIB. The NR SIB area scope mechanism as
specified in TS 38.331 [12] is reused to enable validity area for SL
resource pool configured via broadcasted system information.</p>
<p>The UE is allowed to temporarily use UE autonomous resource selection
with random selection for sidelink transmission based on configuration
of the exceptional transmission resource pool as specified in TS 38.331
[12].</p>
<h3 id="uu-control">16.9.4 Uu Control</h3>
<h4 id="general-16">16.9.4.1 General</h4>
<p>When a UE is inside NG-RAN coverage, NR sidelink communication and/or
V2X sidelink communication can be configured and controlled by NG-RAN
via dedicated signalling or system information:</p>
<p>- The UE should support and be authorized to perform NR sidelink
communication and/or V2X sidelink communication in NG-RAN;</p>
<p>- If configured, the UE performs V2X sidelink communication as
specified in TS 36.300 [2] unless otherwise specified, with the
restriction that the dynamic scheduling for V2X sidelink communication
(i.e. based on SL-V-RNTI) is not supported;</p>
<p>- NG-RAN can provide the UE with intra-carrier sidelink
configuration, inter-carrier sidelink configuration and anchor
carrier(s) which provide sidelink configuration via a Uu carrier for NR
sidelink communication and/or V2X sidelink communication;</p>
<p>- When the UE cannot simultaneously perform both NR sidelink
transmission and NR uplink transmission in time domain, prioritization
between both transmissions is done based on their priorities and
thresholds configured by the NG-RAN or pre-configured. When the UE
cannot simultaneously perform both V2X sidelink transmission and NR
uplink transmission in time domain, prioritization between both
transmissions is done based on the priorities (i.e. PPPP) of V2X
sidelink communication and a threshold configured by the NG-RAN or
pre-configured.</p>
<p>When a UE is outside NG-RAN coverage, SL DRB configuration(s) are
preconfigured to the UE for NR sidelink communication. If UE changes the
RRC state but has not received the SL DRB configuration(s) for the new
RRC state, UE continues using the configuration obtained in the previous
RRC state to perform sidelink data transmissions and receptions until
the configuration for the new RRC state is received.</p>
<h4 id="control-of-connected-ues">16.9.4.2 Control of connected UEs</h4>
<p>The UE in RRC_CONNECTED performs NR sidelink communication and/or V2X
sidelink communication, as configured by the upper layers. The UE sends
Sidelink UE Information to NG-RAN in order to request or release
sidelink resources and report QoS information for each destination.</p>
<p>NG-RAN provides <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> to the UE in order to
provide the UE with dedicated sidelink configuration. The
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> may include SL DRB configuration(s) for NR
sidelink communication as well as mode 1 resource configuration and/or
mode 2 resource configuration. If UE has received SL DRB configuration
via system information, UE should continue using the configuration to
perform sidelink data transmissions and receptions until a new
configuration is received via the <em>RRCReconfiguration</em>.</p>
<p>NG-RAN may also configure measurement and reporting of CBR for NR
sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication, and reporting of
location information for V2X sidelink communication to the UE via
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em>.</p>
<p>During handover, the UE performs sidelink transmission and reception
based on configuration of the exceptional transmission resource pool or
configured sidelink grant Type 1 and reception resource pool of the
target cell as provided in the handover command.</p>
<h4 id="control-of-idleinactive-ues">16.9.4.3 Control of idle/inactive
UEs</h4>
<p>The UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE performs NR sidelink communication
and/or V2X sidelink communication, as configured by the upper layers.
NG-RAN may provide common sidelink configuration to the UE in RRC_IDLE
or RRC_INACTIVE via system information for NR sidelink communication
and/or V2X sidelink communication. UE receives resource pool
configuration and SL DRB configuration via <em>SIB12</em> for NR
sidelink communication as specified in TS 38.331 [12], and/or resource
pool configuration via <em>SIB13</em> and <em>SIB14</em> for V2X
sidelink communication as specified in TS 38.331 [12].</p>
<p>When the UE performs cell reselection, the UE interested in V2X
service(s) considers at least whether NR sidelink communication and/or
V2X sidelink communication are supported by the cell. The UE may
consider the following carrier frequency as the highest priority
frequency, except for the carrier only providing the anchor carrier:</p>
<p>- the frequency providing both NR sidelink communication
configuration and V2X sidelink communication configuration, if
configured to perform both NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink
communication;</p>
<p>- the frequency providing NR sidelink communication configuration, if
configured to perform only NR sidelink communication.</p>
<p>- the frequency providing V2X sidelink communication configuration,
if configured to perform only V2X sidelink communication.</p>
<p>When the UE performs cell reselection, the UE interested in ProSe
service(s) considers at least whether NR sidelink
communication/discovery is supported by the cell. The UE may consider
the carrier frequency providing NR sidelink communication/discovery
configuration as the highest priority frequency, except for the carrier
only providing the anchor carrier.</p>
<h3 id="sidelink-discovery">16.9.5 Sidelink Discovery</h3>
<p>The UE may perform NR sidelink discovery while in-coverage or
out-of-coverage for non-relay operation.</p>
<p>The Relay discovery mechanism described in clause 16.12.3 (except the
U2N Relay specific threshold based discovery message transmission and
U2N Relay specific resource allocation mode restriction) is also applied
to sidelink discovery.</p>
<h3 id="sl-drx">16.9.6 SL DRX</h3>
<h4 id="general-17">16.9.6.1 General</h4>
<p>Sidelink supports SL DRX for unicast, groupcast, and broadcast.
Similar parameters as defined in clause 11 for Uu (on-duration,
inactivity-timer, retransmission-timer, cycle) are defined for SL to
determine the SL active time for SL DRX. During the SL active time, the
UE performs SCI monitoring for data reception (i.e., PSCCH and
2<sup>nd</sup> stage SCI on PSSCH). The UE may skip monitoring of SCI
for data reception during SL DRX inactive time.</p>
<p>The actual parameters supported for each cast type (unicast,
groupcast, broadcast) are specified in the following clauses.</p>
<p>The SL active time of the RX UE includes the time in which any of its
applicable SL on-duration timer(s), SL inactivity-timer(s) or SL HARQ
retransmission timer(s) (for any of unicast, groupcast, or broadcast)
are running. In addition, the slots associated with announced periodic
transmissions by the TX UE and the time in which a UE is expecting CSI
report following a CSI request (for unicast) are considered as SL active
time of the RX UE. The time for the unicast link establishment procedure
and the time for the PC5 RRC reconfiguration with initial SL DRX
configuration procedure as specified in clause 5.28.2 of TS 38.321 [6]
are considered as SL active time of the RX UE.</p>
<p>The TX UE maintains a set of timers corresponding to the SL DRX
timers in the RX UE(s) for each pair of source/destination L2 ID for
unicast or destination L2 ID for groupcast/broadcast. When data is
available for transmission to one or more RX UE(s) configured with SL
DRX, the TX UE selects resources taking into account the active time of
the RX UE(s).</p>
<p>The UE can determine from SIB12 whether the gNB supports SL DRX or
not.</p>
<h4 id="unicast">16.9.6.2 Unicast</h4>
<p>For unicast, SL DRX is configured per pair of source L2 ID and
destination L2 ID.</p>
<p>The UE maintains a set of SL DRX timers for each direction per pair
of source L2 ID and destination L2 ID. The SL DRX configuration for a
pair of source/destination L2 IDs for a direction may be negotiated
between the UEs in the AS layer. For SL DRX configuration of each
direction, where one UE is the TX UE and the other is the RX UE:</p>
<p>- RX UE may send assistance information, which includes its desired
SL on-duration timer, SL DRX start offset, SL DRX slot offset, and SL
DRX cycle, to the TX UE and the TX UE using mode 2 resource allocation
may use it to determine the SL DRX configuration for the RX UE;</p>
<p>- Regardless of whether assistance information is provided or not,
the TX UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC, or in RRC_CONNECTED and using
mode 2 resource allocation, determines the SL DRX Configuration for the
RX UE. For a TX UE in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource
allocation, the SL DRX configuration for the RX UE is determined by the
serving gNB of the TX UE;</p>
<p>- TX UE sends the SL DRX configuration to be used by the RX UE to the
RX UE;</p>
<p>- The RX UE may accept or reject the SL DRX configuration.</p>
<p>When the TX UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource
allocation, the TX UE may report the received assistance information or
the received SL DRX configuration reject information to its serving gNB
supporting SL DRX and sends the SL DRX configuration to the RX UE upon
receiving the SL DRX configuration in dedicated RRC signalling from the
gNB. When the RX UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource
allocation, the RX UE can report the received SL DRX configuration to
its serving gNB supporting SL DRX, e.g. for alignment of the Uu and SL
DRX configurations.</p>
<p>SL on-duration timer, SL inactivity-timer, SL HARQ RTT timer, and SL
HARQ retransmission timer are supported in unicast. SL HARQ RTT timer
and SL HARQ retransmission timer are maintained per SL process at the RX
UE. In addition to (pre)configured values for each of these timers, SL
HARQ RTT timer value can be derived from the retransmission resource
timing when SCI indicates more than one transmission resource. SL HARQ
RTT timer can be set to different values to support both HARQ enabled
and HARQ disabled transmissions.</p>
<p>SL DRX MAC CE is introduced for SL DRX operation in unicast only.</p>
<h4 id="groupcastbroadcast">16.9.6.3 Groupcast/Broadcast</h4>
<p>For groupcast/broadcast, SL DRX is configured commonly among multiple
UEs based on QoS profile and Destination L2 ID. Multiple SL DRX
configurations can be supported for each of groupcast/broadcast.</p>
<p>SL on-duration timer, SL inactivity-timer, SL HARQ RTT and SL HARQ
retransmission timers are supported for groupcast. Only SL on-duration
timer is supported for broadcast. SL DRX cycle, SL on-duration, and SL
inactivity timer (only for groupcast) are configured per QoS profile.
The starting offset and slot offset of the SL DRX cycle is determined
based on the destination L2 ID. The SL HARQ RTT timer (only for
groupcast) and SL HARQ retransmission timer (only for groupcast) are not
configured per QoS profile or per destination L2 ID. For groupcast, the
RX UE maintains a SL inactivity timer for each destination L2 ID, and
selects the largest SL inactivity timer value if multiple SL inactivity
timer values associated with different QoS profiles are configured for
that L2 ID. For groupcast and broadcast, the RX UE maintains a single SL
DRX cycle (selected as the smallest SL DRX cycle of any QoS profile of
that L2 ID) and single SL on-duration (selected as the largest SL
on-duration of any QoS profile of that L2 ID) for each destination L2 ID
when multiple QoS profiles are configured for that L2 ID.</p>
<p>For groupcast, SL HARQ RTT timer and SL HARQ retransmission timer are
maintained per SL process at the RX UE. SL HARQ RTT timer can be set to
different values to support both HARQ enabled and HARQ disabled
transmissions.</p>
<p>A default SL DRX configuration, common between groupcast and
broadcast, can be used for a QoS profile which is not mapped onto any
non-default SL DRX configuration(s). The default SL DRX configuration
for groupcast and broadcast can also be used for discovery message in
sidelink discovery in clause 16.9.5 and relay discovery messages in
clause 16.12.3, for ProSe Direct Link Establishment Request message as
specified in TS 24.554 [55], and for Direct Link Establishment Request
message as specified in TS 24.587 [53].</p>
<p>In-coverage TX and RX UEs in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE obtain their SL
DRX configuration from SIB. UEs (TX or RX) in RRC_CONNECTED can obtain
the SL DRX configuration from SIB, or from dedicated RRC signalling
during handover. For the out of coverage case, the SL DRX configuration
is obtained from pre-configuration.</p>
<p>For groupcast, the TX UE restarts its timer corresponding to the SL
inactivity timer for the destination L2 ID (used for determining the
allowable transmission time) upon reception of new data with the same
destination L2 ID.</p>
<p>TX profile is introduced to ensure compatibility for groupcast and
broadcast communication between UEs supporting/not-supporting SL DRX
functionality. A TX profile is provided by upper layers to AS layer and
identifies one or more sidelink feature group(s). Multiple TX profiles
with the support of SL DRX and without the support of SL DRX can be
associated to a destination L2 ID. For a given destination L2 ID, all TX
and RX UEs should be configured with the same set of TX profile(s). A UE
only assumes SL DRX for the given destination L2 ID when all the
associated TX profiles correspond to support of SL DRX. A UE assumes no
SL DRX for the given destination L2 ID if there is no associated TX
profile. An RX UE determines that SL DRX is used if all destination L2
IDs of interest are assumed to support SL DRX. For groupcast, when the
UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource allocation, the UE
reports each destination L2 ID and associated SL DRX on/off indication
to the gNB supporting SL DRX.</p>
<h4 id="alignment-between-uu-drx-and-sl-drx">16.9.6.4 Alignment between
Uu DRX and SL DRX</h4>
<p>Alignment of Uu DRX and SL DRX for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED is supported
for unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. Alignment of Uu DRX and SL DRX at
the same UE is supported. In addition, for mode 1 resource allocation,
the alignment of Uu DRX of the TX UE and SL DRX of the RX UE is
supported.</p>
<p>Alignment may comprise of either full overlap or partial overlap in
time between Uu DRX and SL DRX. For SL RX UEs in RRC_CONNECTED,
alignment is achieved by the gNB.</p>
<h3 id="power-savings-resource-allocation">16.9.7 Power Savings Resource
Allocation</h3>
<p>The SL UE in Mode 2 can support partial sensing-based resource
allocation and random resource selection as power saving resource
allocation methods. A SL mode 2 TX resource pool can be (pre)configured
to allow full sensing only, partial sensing only, random selection only,
or any combination(s) thereof. A UE decides which resource allocation
scheme(s) can be used in the AS based on its capability (for a UE in
RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC) and the allowed resource schemes in the
resource pool configuration.</p>
<p>Random resource selection is applicable to both periodic and
aperiodic traffic.</p>
<p>A UE capable for partial sensing can perform periodic-based partial
sensing and/or contiguous partial sensing for resource (re)selection.
Periodic-based partial sensing can only be performed if periodic
resource reservation is configured in the resource pool. In
periodic-based partial sensing, the UE monitors slots in periodic
sensing occasion(s) for a given resource reservation periodicity.
Contiguous partial sensing is performed by a UE capable of partial
sensing when resource (re)selection is triggered by a UE in a TX pool
configured with partial sensing. In contiguous partial sensing, the UE
monitors slots in a contiguous sensing window which occur prior to the
selected transmission resource.</p>
<h3 id="inter-ue-coordination-iuc">16.9.8 Inter-UE Coordination
(IUC)</h3>
<p>The SL UE can support inter-UE coordination (IUC) in Mode 2, whereby
a UE sends information about resources to a peer UE, which the peer UE
then uses for resource (re)selection. The following schemes of inter-UE
coordination are supported:</p>
<p>- IUC scheme 1, where the IUC information sent from a UE to a peer UE
is the preferred or non-preferred resources for the peer UE's
transmission, and</p>
<p>- IUC scheme 2, where the IUC information sent from a UE to a peer UE
is the presence of expected/potential resource conflict on the resources
indicated by the peer UE's SCI.</p>
<p>In scheme 1, the transmission of IUC information from a UE can be
triggered by a condition at this UE, or by an explicit request from a
peer UE. The UE determines the set of resources reserved by other UEs or
slots where the UE, when it is the intended receiver of the peer UE,
does not expect to perform SL reception from the peer UE due to
half-duplex operation. The UE uses these resources as the set of
non-preferred resources, or excludes these resources to determine a set
of preferred resources and sends the preferred/non-preferred resources
to the peer UE. Regarding the IUC information received from the UE, the
peer UE's resources for resource (re)selection can be based on both the
peer UE's sensing results (if available) and the IUC information, or it
can be based only on the IUC information. For scheme 1, MAC CE and
second-stage SCI or MAC CE only can be used to send IUC information. For
IUC information transmission triggered by an explicit request, both the
explicit request and the IUC information are transmitted in unicast
manner. For IUC information transmission triggered by a condition other
than the explicit request, the IUC information indicating preferred
resource set is transmitted in unicast manner, and the IUC information
indicating non-preferred resource set is transmitted in unicast,
groupcast or broadcast manner.</p>
<p>In scheme 2, a UE determines the expected/potential resource conflict
within the resources indicated by a peer UE's SCI as either resources
reserved by other UEs and identified by the UE as fully/partially
overlapping with the resources indicated by the peer UE's SCI, or as
slots where the UE is the intended receiver of the peer UE and does not
expect to perform SL reception on those slots due to half-duplex
operation. The peer UE uses the conflicting resources to determine the
resources to be reselected and exclude the conflicting resources from
the reselected resources. For scheme 2, PSFCH is used to send IUC
information.</p>

<h3 id="multicast-handling">16.10.5 Multicast Handling</h3>
<h4 id="session-management">16.10.5.1 Session Management</h4>
<p>There are two delivery modes as specified in TS 23.247 [45]:</p>
<p>- 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery;</p>
<p>- 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery.</p>
<p>As specified in TS 23.247 [45], if the gNB supports MBS, the network
shall use the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery in which case an MBS
Session Resource context for a multicast session is setup in the gNB
when the first UE joins the multicast session.</p>
<p>For 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery mode, shared NG-U resources are
used to provide MBS user data to the gNB. The gNB initiates the
Multicast Distribution Setup procedure towards the 5GC, to allocate
shared NG-U resources for a multicast session. In case multiple MBS
session areas as specified in TS 23.247 [45] are associated with the
same multicast session for location dependent MBS services, multiple
NG-U shared resources are established for the same multicast session per
MBS Area Session ID served by the gNB.</p>
<p>A shared NG-U resource applies one of the following transport
options:</p>
<p>- unicast transport;</p>
<p>- multicast transport.</p>
<p>For 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery an MBS Session Resource comprises
one or several MRBs. If minimisation of data loss is applied for a given
MRB, synchronisation of allocation of PDCP COUNT values is applied by
either or a combination of the following methods:</p>
<p>- derivation of the PDCP COUNT values by means of a DL MBS QFI
Sequence Number provided on NG-U. Synchronisation in terms of MBS QoS
flow to MRB mapping and PDCP SN size of the corresponding MRB among gNBs
are achieved by means of network implementation.</p>
<p>- deployment of a Shared NG-U Termination at NG-RAN, shared among
gNBs, which comprises a common entity for assignment of PDCP COUNT
values. Synchronisation in terms of MBS QoS flow to MRB mapping and PDCP
SN size of the corresponding MRB among gNBs may be achieved by means of
network implementation.</p>
<p>If PDCP COUNT values are derived from a DL MBS QFI Sequence Number
provided on NG-U and only one QoS Flow is mapped to an MRB, the gNB
shall set the PDCP COUNT value of PDCP PDU to the value of the DL MBS
QFI Sequence Number provided with the received packet over NG-U. If PDCP
COUNT values are derived from a DL MBS QFI Sequence Number provided on
NG-U and multiple QoS Flows are mapped to an MRB, the gNB may derive the
PDCP COUNT value of the PDCP PDU from the sum of the DL MBS QFI Sequence
Numbers of the QoS Flows mapped to this MRB.</p>
<p>NOTE: Synchronisation of PDCP COUNT values in case user data for MBS
QoS flows mapped to the same MRB arrive over NG-U at different gNBs in
different order or in case of loss of data over NG-U, and related
handling of minimisation of data loss is left to implementation.</p>
<h4 id="configuration">16.10.5.2 Configuration</h4>
<p>A UE can receive data of MBS multicast session only in RRC_CONNECTED
state. If the UE which joined a multicast session is in RRC_CONNECTED
state and when the multicast session is activated, the gNB may send
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message with relevant MBS configuration for
the multicast session to the UE.</p>
<p>When there is temporarily no data to be sent to the UEs for a
multicast session that is active, the gNB may move the UE to
RRC_INACTIVE state. When an MBS multicast session is deactivated, the
gNB may move the UE to RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state. gNBs supporting
MBS use a group notification mechanism to notify the UEs in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE state when a multicast session has been activated by the
CN. gNBs supporting MBS use a group notification mechanism to notify the
UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state when the session is already activated and the
gNB has multicast session data to deliver. Upon reception of the group
notification, the UEs reconnect to the network or resume the connection
and transition to RRC_CONNECTED state. The group notification is
addressed with P-RNTI on PDCCH, and the paging channels are monitored by
the UE as described in clause 9.2.5. Paging message for group
notification contains MBS session ID which is utilized to page all UEs
in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states that joined the associated MBS
multicast session, i.e., UEs are not paged individually. The UE stops
monitoring for group notifications related to a specific multicast
session, i.e., stops checking for the MBS session ID in the Paging
message, when the UE enters RRC_CONNECTED state. The UE does not monitor
for group notifications for these cases, i.e., once this UE leaves this
multicast session or the network requests the UE to leave, or the
network releases the multicast session.</p>
<p>NOTE: The gNB's decision to keep a UE in RRC_CONNECTED (e.g., to meet
latency requirements for mission critical service) or move the UE to
RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE (e.g., when there is temporarily no data to be
sent to the UE or to address congestion in the cell) may consider 5QI
value(s) or other QoS parameters for mission critical and non-mission
critical UEs.</p>
<p>If the UE in RRC_IDLE state that joined an MBS multicast session is
camping on the gNB not supporting MBS, the UE may be notified by
CN-initiated paging where CN pages each UE individually due to session
activation or data availability, as described in clause 9.2.5. If the UE
in RRC_INACTIVE state that joined MBS multicast session is camping on
the gNB not supporting MBS, the UE may be notified individually by
RAN-initiated paging due to session activation or data availability, as
described in clause 9.2.5.</p>

<h5 id="handover-between-multicast-supporting-cells">16.10.5.3.2
Handover between Multicast supporting cells</h5>
<p>Mobility procedures for multicast reception allow the UE to continue
receiving multicast service(s) via PTM or PTP in a new cell after
handover.</p>
<p>During handover preparation phase, the source gNB transfers to the
target gNB about the MBS multicast sessions the UE has joined in the UE
context information. To support provision of local multicast service
with location dependent content as specified in TS 23.247 [45], for each
active multicast session, service area information per Area Session ID
may be provided to the target gNB.</p>
<p>The source gNB may propose data forwarding for some MRBs to minimize
data loss and may exchange the corresponding MRB PDCP Sequence Number
with the target gNB during the handover preparation:</p>
<p>- The lossless handover for multicast service is supported for the
handover between MBS supporting cells if the UE is configured with PTP
RLC AM entity in target cell MRB of a UE, regardless of whether the UE
is configured with PTP RLC AM entity in the source cell or not.</p>
<p>- In order to support lossless handover for multicast service, the
network has to ensure DL PDCP COUNT value synchronization and continuity
between the source cell and the target cell. Furthermore, data
forwarding from the source gNB to the target gNB and/or PDCP status
report provided by a UE for an MRB for multicast session can be used
during lossless handover.</p>
<p>For each multicast session with ongoing user data transmission for
which no MBS Session Resources exist at the target gNB, the target gNB
triggers the setup of MBS user plane resources towards the 5GC using the
NGAP Distribution Setup procedure. If unicast transport is used, the
target gNB provides the DL tunnel endpoint to be used to the MB-SMF. If
multicast transport is used, the target gNB receives the IP multicast
address from the MB-SMF.</p>
<p>During handover execution, the MBS configuration decided at target
gNB is sent to the UE via the source gNB within an RRC container as
specified in TS 38.331 [12]. The PDCP entities for multicast MRBs in the
UE can either be re-established or remain as it is. When the UE connects
to the target gNB, the target gNB sends an indication that it is an
MBS-supporting node to the SMF in the Path Switch Request message (Xn
handover) or Handover Request Acknowledge message (NG handover).</p>
<p>Upon successful handover completion, the source gNB may trigger the
release of the MBS user plane resources towards the 5GC using the NGAP
Distribution Release procedure for any multicast session for which there
is no remaining joined UE in the gNB.</p>
<h5
id="handover-between-multicast-supporting-cell-and-multicast-non-supporting-cell">16.10.5.3.3
Handover between Multicast-supporting cell and Multicast non-supporting
cell</h5>
<p>During an MBS multicast session, at mobility from an MBS-supporting
cell to an MBS non-supporting cell, the target gNB sets up PDU Session
Resources mapped to the MBS multicast session. The 5GC infers from the
absence of an "MBS-support" indication from gNB in the Path Switch
Request message (Xn handover) or Handover Request Acknowledge message
(NG handover) that MBS multicast data packets delivery has to be
switched to 5GC individual MBS traffic delivery as specified in TS
23.247 [45]. If data forwarding is applied, the source gNB infers from
the handover preparation response message that the target gNB does not
support MBS and changes the QFI(s) in the forwarded packets to the
associated PDU Session QFI(s) if respective mapping information is
available. The source gNB may be aware that the target gNB is non-MBS
supporting already before Handover Preparation.</p>
<p>For mobility from MBS non-supporting cell to MBS-supporting cell, the
existing Xn/NG handover procedures apply. The 5GC infers from the
presence of the "MBS-support" indicator from gNB in the Path Switch
Request message (Xn handover) or in the Handover Request Acknowledge
message (NG handover) that MBS multicast data packets delivery can be
switched from 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery to 5GC Shared MBS
traffic delivery. After Xn handover, the SMF triggers switching MBS
multicast data packets delivery from 5GC Individual to 5GC Shared MBS
traffic delivery by providing MBS Session IDs joined by the UE to the
target gNB by means of the PDU Session Resource Modification procedure.
For NG handover, the SMF provides the MBS Session IDs joined by the UE
to the target gNB by means of NGAP Handover Request. Minimization of
data loss and duplication avoidance may be applied by means of identical
MBS QFI SNs received over the shared NG-U tunnel against those received
over unicast NG-U tunnels or forwarding tunnels.</p>
<p>Mobility from a multicast-supporting cell to a multicast
non-supporting cell can be achieved by switching the MRB to a DRB in the
source gNB before a handover.</p>
<p>NOTE: A UE may be handed over to a target gNB not supporting MBS
without prior reconfiguration from MRB to the DRB in the source gNB. In
this case, the AS configuration may not be comprehended by the target
gNB causing full configuration.</p>
<h5 id="mrb-reconfiguration">16.10.5.3.4 MRB reconfiguration</h5>
<p>The gNB may use <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to configure or
reconfigure a multicast MRB, e.g., add/release/modify the MRB's RLC
entities as described in clause 16.10.3. In order to minimize the data
loss due to MRB reconfiguration, gNB may configure UE to send a PDCP
status report during reconfiguration for MRB type change.</p>
<h4 id="reception-of-mbs-multicast-data">16.10.5.4 Reception of MBS
Multicast data</h4>
<p>For multicast service, gNB may deliver MBS multicast data packets
using the following methods:</p>
<p>- PTP Transmission: gNB individually delivers separate copies of MBS
data packets to each UEs independently, i.e., gNB uses UE-specific PDCCH
with CRC scrambled by UE-specific RNTI (e.g., C-RNTI) to schedule
UE-specific PDSCH which is scrambled with the same UE-specific RNTI.</p>
<p>- PTM Transmission: gNB delivers a single copy of MBS data packets to
a set of UEs, e.g., gNB uses group-common PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
group-common RNTI to schedule group-common PDSCH which is scrambled with
the same group-common RNTI.</p>
<p>If a UE is configured with both PTM and PTP transmissions, a gNB
dynamically decides whether to deliver multicast data by PTM leg and/or
PTP leg for a given UE based on the protocol stack defined in clause
16.10.3, based on information such as MBS Session QoS requirements,
number of joined UEs, UE individual feedback on reception quality, and
other criteria. The same QoS requirements apply regardless of the
decision.</p>
<h4 id="support-of-ca">16.10.5.5 Support of CA</h4>
<p>UE can be configured to receive MBS multicast data either from a
PCell or a single SCell at a time.</p>
<h4 id="drx">16.10.5.6 DRX</h4>
<p>The following DRX configurations for PTM/PTP transmission are
possible:</p>
<p>- For PTM transmission, multicast DRX is configured per
G-RNTI/G-CS-RNTI which is independent of UE-specific DRX;</p>
<p>- For PTP transmission, UE-specific DRX is reused, i.e., UE-specific
DRX is used for both unicast transmission and PTP transmission of MBS
multicast. For PTM retransmission via PTP, UE monitors PDCCH scrambled
by C-RNTI/CS-RNTI during UE-specific DRX's Active Time.</p>
<h4 id="physical-layer-1">16.10.5.7 Physical Layer</h4>
<p>A CFR configured by <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message is defined
for multicast scheduling as an 'MBS frequency region' with a number of
contiguous PRBs confined within and with the same numerology as the DL
BWP, and multicast scheduling may have specific characteristics (e.g.,
PDCCH, PDSCH and SPS configurations).</p>
<p>Two HARQ-ACK reporting modes are defined for MBS:</p>
<p>- For the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE generates HARQ-ACK
information with ACK value when a UE correctly decodes a transport block
or detects a DCI format indicating an SPS PDSCH release; otherwise, the
UE generates HARQ-ACK information with NACK value.</p>
<p>- For the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE does not transmit a
PUCCH that would include only HARQ-ACK information with ACK values.</p>
<p>HARQ-ACK feedback for multicast can be enabled or disabled by higher
layer configuration per G-RNTI or per G-CS-RNTI and/or indication in the
DCI scheduling multicast transmission.</p>

<h4 id="configuration-1">16.10.6.2 Configuration</h4>
<p>MBS broadcast can be received by UEs in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and
RRC_CONNECTED state. A UE can receive the MBS configuration for
broadcast session (e.g., parameters needed for MTCH reception) via MCCH
in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED state. The parameters needed
for the reception of MCCH are provided via System Information.</p>
<p>The following principles govern the MCCH structure:</p>
<p>- MCCH provides the list of all broadcast services with ongoing
sessions transmitted on MTCH(s) and the associated information for
broadcast session includes MBS session ID, associated G-RNTI scheduling
information and information about neighbouring cells providing certain
service on MTCH(s). MCCH content is transmitted within periodically
occurring time domain windows, referred to as MCCH transmission window
defined by MCCH repetition period, MCCH window duration and radio
frame/slot offset;</p>
<p>- MCCH uses a modification period and MCCH contents are only allowed
to be modified at each modification period boundary; a notification
mechanism is used to announce the change of MCCH contents due to
broadcast session start, modification or stop and due to neighbouring
cell information modification;</p>
<p>NOTE: It is up to UE implementation to use the start and stop times
in the USD to determine when to start monitoring the MCCH for the
session the UE is interested in.</p>
<p>- When the UE receives an MCCH change notification, it acquires the
updated MCCH in the same MCCH modification period where the change
notification is sent.</p>
<h4 id="support-of-ca-1">16.10.6.3 Support of CA</h4>
<p>UE can be configured to receive MBS broadcast data and MCCH either
from a PCell or a single SCell at a time. Meanwhile, dedicated RRC
signalling is used for providing SIB20 of the SCell i.e., while in
RRC_CONNECTED state, UEs need not acquire broadcast SIB20 directly from
the SCells.</p>
<p>NOTE: The UE may be able to receive MBS broadcast also from a
non-serving cell, which is transparent to the network, e.g., it does not
require UE capability or MBS Interest Indication to be sent by the
UE.</p>
<h4 id="drx-1">16.10.6.4 DRX</h4>

continue receiving MBS service(s) when changing cells. The gNB may
indicate in the MCCH the list of neighbour cells providing the same MBS
broadcast service(s) as provided in the serving cell. This allows the
UE, e.g., to request unicast reception of the service before moving to a
cell not providing the MBS broadcast service(s) using PTM transmission.
To avoid the need to read MBS broadcast related system information and
potentially MCCH on neighbour frequencies, the UE is made aware of which
frequency is providing which MBS broadcast services via PTM, through
<em>User Service Description</em>, as defined in TS 26.517 [46], or the
combination of the following:</p>
<p>- <em>User Service Description</em> (USD);</p>
<p>- SIB21, as defined in clause 7.3.1.</p>
<p>NOTE: UE can request unicast reception of the service after moving to
a cell not providing the MBS broadcast service(s) using PTM
transmission.</p>
<p>In RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE, the UE applies the normal cell
reselection rules with the following modifications:</p>
<p>- the UE which is receiving or interested to receive MBS broadcast
service(s) via PTM and can only receive these MBS broadcast service(s)
via PTM while camping on the frequency providing these MBS broadcast
service(s) is allowed to make this frequency highest priority when the
conditions described in TS 38.304 [10] are met;</p>
<p>- when the MBS broadcast service(s) which the UE is interested in are
no longer available (after the end of the session) or the UE is no
longer interested in receiving the service(s), the UE no longer
prioritises the frequency providing these MBS broadcast service(s).</p>
<h5 id="service-continuity-in-rrc_connected">16.10.6.5.2 Service
Continuity in RRC_CONNECTED</h5>
<p>To ensure service continuity of MBS broadcast, the UE in
RRC_CONNECTED state may send MBS Interest Indication to the gNB,
consisting of the following information:</p>
<p>- List of MBS frequencies UE is receiving or interested to receive,
sorted in decreasing order of interest;</p>
<p>- Priority between the reception of all listed MBS frequencies and
the reception of any unicast bearer and multicast MRB;</p>
<p>- List of MBS broadcast services the UE is receiving or interested to
receive, in case SIB20 is provided for PCell or SCell.</p>
<p>MBS Interest Indication information reporting can be implicitly
enabled/disabled by the presence of SIB21.</p>
<p>The gNB may use this information, together with the information about
the UE's capabilities (e.g., supported band combinations), when
providing an RRC configuration and/or downlink assignments to the UE or
to release DRBs/multicast MRBs, to allow the UE to receive the MBS
services the UE is interested in. MBS Interest Indication information
can be exchanged between source gNB and target gNB during handover.</p>
<h4 id="a-reception-of-mbs-broadcast-data">16.10.6.5A Reception of MBS
Broadcast data</h4>
<p>For broadcast service, gNB may deliver Broadcast MBS data packets
using the following method:</p>
<p>- PTM Transmission: gNB delivers a single copy of MBS data packets to
a set of UEs, e.g., gNB uses group-common PDCCH with CRC scrambled by
group-common RNTI to schedule group-common PDSCH which is scrambled with
the same group-common RNTI.</p>
<h4 id="physical-layer-2">16.10.6.6 Physical Layer</h4>
<p>A CFR configured by SIB is defined for broadcast scheduling as an
'MBS frequency region' with a number of contiguous PRBs with a bandwidth
equal to or larger than CORESET0, with the same numerology as CORESET0,
and broadcast scheduling may have specific characteristics (e.g., PDCCH
and PDSCH configurations).</p>
<p>The maximum number of MIMO layers is one for MBS broadcast
scheduling. RB-level rate matching, and RE-level rate matching around
LTE-CRS configured by higher layer signalling are supported for MCCH and
MTCH. Slot-level repetition is supported for MTCH.</p>
<p>HARQ-ACK feedback is not supported for MBS broadcast.</p>
<p>Only dynamic scheduling is supported for MBS broadcast.</p>
<h2 id="minimization-of-service-interruption">16.11 Minimization of
Service Interruption</h2>
<p>In case of a disaster, a radio access network can experience outage,
which can result in that UEs belonging to the network experience service
interruptions. For this scenario, another network not affected by the
disaster, which during non-disaster situations is considered by the UEs
as a forbidden network, can allow roaming of the UEs belonging to the
network experiencing such disaster service interruptions. Such roaming
is referred to as disaster roaming. This is further described in clause
5.40 of TS 23.501 [3] and 3.10 of TS 23.122 [47].</p>
<p>To allow such disaster roaming, a cell can broadcast a list of PLMNs
with disaster conditions for which disaster roaming is offered. Disaster
roaming service is provided only for the area that covers the area with
disaster condition.</p>
<p>Further, to be able to control the load that disaster roaming UEs put
on a cell, the cell can broadcast access control parameters applicable
specifically for disaster roaming UEs. Access attempts of disaster
roaming UEs are based on Access Identity 3. The network can for example
set the access control parameters for Access Identity 3 so that access
attempts of disaster roaming UEs are more likely to be barred compared
to non-disaster roaming UEs.</p>
<h2 id="sidelink-relay">16.12 Sidelink Relay</h2>
<h3 id="general-21">16.12.1 General</h3>
<p>Sidelink relay is introduced to support 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay
(U2N Relay) function (specified in TS 23.304 [48]) to provide
connectivity to the network for U2N Remote UE(s). Both L2 and L3 U2N
Relay architectures are supported. The L3 U2N Relay architecture is
transparent to the serving NG-RAN of the U2N Relay UE, except for
controlling sidelink resources. The detailed architecture and procedures
for L3 U2N Relay can be found in TS 23.304 [48].</p>
<p>A U2N Relay UE shall be in RRC_CONNECTED to perform relaying of
unicast data.</p>
<p>For L2 U2N Relay operation, the following RRC state combinations are
supported:</p>
<p>- Both L2 U2N Relay UE and L2 U2N Remote UE shall be in RRC_CONNECTED
to perform transmission/reception of relayed unicast data; and</p>
<p>- The L2 U2N Relay UE can be in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or
RRC_CONNECTED as long as all the L2 U2N Remote UE(s) that are connected
to the L2 U2N Relay UE are either in RRC_INACTIVE or in RRC_IDLE.</p>
<p>A single unicast link is established between one L2 U2N Relay UE and
one L2 U2N Remote UE. The traffic to the NG-RAN of L2 U2N Remote UE via
a given L2 U2N Relay UE and the traffic of the L2 U2N Relay UE shall be
separated in different Uu RLC channels.</p>
<p>For L2 U2N Relay, the L2 U2N Remote UE can only be configured to use
resource allocation mode 2 (as specified in 5.7.2 and 16.9.3.1) for data
to be relayed.</p>
<h3 id="protocol-architecture-1">16.12.2 Protocol Architecture</h3>
<h4 id="l2-ue-to-network-relay">16.12.2.1 L2 UE-to-Network Relay</h4>
<p>The protocol stacks for the user plane and control plane of L2 U2N
Relay architecture are illustrated in Figure 16.12.2.1-1 and Figure
16.12.2.1-2. The SRAP sublayer is placed above the RLC sublayer for both
CP and UP at both PC5 interface and Uu interface. The Uu SDAP, PDCP and
RRC are terminated between L2 U2N Remote UE and gNB, while SRAP, RLC,
MAC and PHY are terminated in each hop (i.e., the link between L2 U2N
Remote UE and the L2 U2N Relay UE and the link between L2 U2N Relay UE
and the gNB).</p>
<p>For L2 U2N Relay, the SRAP sublayer over PC5 hop is only for the
purpose of bearer mapping. The SRAP sublayer is not present over PC5 hop
for relaying the L2 U2N Remote UE's message on BCCH and PCCH. For L2 U2N
Remote UE's message on SRB0, the SRAP header is not present over PC5
hop, but the SRAP header is present over Uu hop for both DL and UL.</p>

<p>Figure 16.12.2.1-2: Control plane protocol stack for L2 UE-to-Network
Relay</p>
<p>For L2 U2N Relay, for uplink:</p>
<p>- The Uu SRAP sublayer performs UL bearer mapping between end-to-end
Uu Radio Bearers of L2 U2N remote UE (identified for the purposes of
this mapping by the local Remote UE ID and an associated bearer ID) and
egress Uu Relay RLC channels over the L2 U2N Relay UE Uu interface. For
uplink relaying traffic, the different end-to-end Uu Radio Bearers (SRBs
or DRBs) of the same L2 U2N Remote UE and/or different L2 U2N Remote UEs
can be multiplexed over the same egress Uu Relay RLC channel;</p>
<p>- The Uu SRAP sublayer supports L2 U2N Remote UE identification for
the UL traffic. The identity information of L2 U2N Remote UE end-to-end
Uu Radio Bearer and a local Remote UE ID are included in the Uu SRAP
header at UL in order for gNB to correlate the received packets for the
specific PDCP entity associated with the right end-to-end Uu Radio
Bearer of the L2 U2N Remote UE;</p>
<p>- The PC5 SRAP sublayer at the L2 U2N Remote UE supports UL bearer
mapping between L2 U2N Remote UE end-to-end Uu Radio Bearers and egress
PC5 Relay RLC channels.</p>
<p>For L2 U2N Relay, for downlink:</p>
<p>- The Uu SRAP sublayer performs DL bearer mapping at gNB to map
end-to-end Uu Radio Bearer (SRB, DRB) of L2 U2N Remote UE (identified
for the purposes of this mapping by the local Remote UE ID and an
associated bearer ID) into Uu Relay RLC channel. The Uu SRAP sublayer
performs DL bearer mapping and data multiplexing between multiple
end-to-end Radio Bearers (SRBs or DRBs) of a L2 U2N Remote UE and/or
different L2 U2N Remote UEs and one Uu Relay RLC channel over the L2 U2N
Relay UE Uu interface;</p>
<p>- The Uu SRAP sublayer supports L2 U2N Remote UE identification for
DL traffic. The identity information of L2 U2N Remote UE end-to-end Uu
Radio Bearer and a local Remote UE ID are included into the Uu SRAP
header by the gNB at DL for the L2 U2N Relay UE to identify the
corresponding end-to-end Uu Radio Bearer(s) of L2 U2N Remote UE;</p>
<p>- The PC5 SRAP sublayer at the L2 U2N Relay UE performs DL bearer
mapping between end-to-end Uu Radio Bearers of L2 U2N remote UE and
egress PC5 Relay RLC channels;</p>
<p>- The PC5 SRAP sublayer at the L2 U2N Remote UE correlates the
received packets with the right PDCP entity associated with the given
end-to-end Uu Radio Bearer of the L2 U2N Remote UE based on the identity
information included in the PC5 SRAP header.</p>
<p>A local Remote UE ID is included in both PC5 SRAP header and Uu SRAP
header. L2 U2N Relay UE is configured by the gNB with the local Remote
UE ID(s) to be used in SRAP header. L2 U2N Remote UE obtains the local
Remote ID from the gNB via Uu RRC messages including <em>RRCSetup</em>,
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em>, <em>RRCResume</em> and
<em>RRCReestablishment</em>.</p>
<p>The end-to-end DRB(s) or end-to-end SRB(s), except SRB0, of L2 U2N
Remote UE can be multiplexed to the PC5 Relay RLC channels and Uu Relay
RLC channels in both PC5 hop and Uu hop, but an end-to-end DRB and an
end-to-end SRB can neither be mapped into the same PC5 Relay RLC channel
nor be mapped into the same Uu Relay RLC channel.</p>
<p>It is the gNB responsibility to avoid collision on the usage of local
Remote UE ID. The gNB can update the local Remote UE ID by sending the
updated local Remote UE ID via <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message. The
serving gNB can perform local Remote UE ID update independent of the PC5
unicast link L2 ID update procedure.</p>
<h3 id="relay-discovery">16.12.3 Relay Discovery</h3>
<p>Model A and Model B discovery models as defined in TS 23.304 [48] are
supported for U2N Relay discovery. The protocol stack used for discovery
is illustrated in Figure 16.12.3-1.</p>
<p><img src="media/image81.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.12.3-1: Protocol Stack of Discovery Message for
UE-to-Network Relay</p>
<p>The U2N Remote UE can perform Relay discovery message (i.e., as
specified in TS 23.304 [48]) transmission and may monitor the sidelink
for Relay discovery message while in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or
RRC_CONNECTED. The network may broadcast or configure via dedicated RRC
signalling a Uu RSRP threshold, which is used by the U2N Remote UE to
determine if it can transmit Relay discovery messages to U2N Relay
UE(s).</p>
<p>The U2N Relay UE can perform Relay discovery message (i.e., as
specified in TS 23.304 [48]) transmission and may monitor the sidelink
for Relay discovery message while in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or
RRC_CONNECTED. The network may broadcast or configure via dedicated RRC
signalling a maximum Uu RSRP threshold, a minimum Uu RSRP threshold, or
both, which are used by the U2N Relay UE to determine if it can transmit
Relay discovery messages to U2N Remote UE(s).</p>
<p>The network may provide the Relay discovery configuration using
broadcast or dedicated signalling. In addition, the U2N Remote UE and L3
U2N Relay UE may use pre-configuration for Relay discovery.</p>
<p>The resource pool(s) used for NR sidelink communication can be used
for Relay discovery or the network may configure resource pool(s)
dedicated for Relay discovery. Resource pool(s) dedicated for Relay
discovery can be configured simultaneously with resource pool(s) for NR
sidelink communication in system information, dedicated signalling
and/or pre-configuration. Whether dedicated resource pool(s) for Relay
discovery are configured is based on network implementation. If resource
pool(s) dedicated for Relay discovery are configured, only those
resource pool(s) dedicated for Relay discovery shall be used for Relay
discovery. If only resource pool(s) for NR sidelink communication are
configured, all the configured resource pool(s) can be used for Relay
discovery and NR sidelink communication.</p>
<p>For U2N Remote UE (including both in-coverage and out of coverage
cases) that has been connected to the network via a U2N Relay UE, only
resource allocation mode 2 is used for Relay discovery message
transmission.</p>
<p>For in-coverage U2N Relay UE, and for both in-coverage and out of
coverage U2N Remote UEs, NR sidelink resource allocation principles are
applied for Relay discovery message transmission.</p>
<p>The sidelink power control for the transmission of Relay discovery
messages is same as for NR sidelink communication.</p>
<p>No ciphering or integrity protection in PDCP layer is applied for the
Relay discovery messages.</p>
<p>The U2N Remote UE and U2N Relay UE can determine from SIB12 whether
the gNB supports Relay discovery, or Non-Relay discovery, or both.</p>
<h3 id="relay-selectionreselection">16.12.4 Relay
Selection/Reselection</h3>
<p>The U2N Remote UE performs radio measurements at PC5 interface and
uses them for U2N Relay selection and reselection along with higher
layer criteria, as specified in TS 23.304 [48]. When there is no unicast
PC5 connection between the U2N Relay UE and the U2N Remote UE, the U2N
Remote UE uses SD-RSRP measurements to evaluate whether PC5 link quality
towards a U2N Relay UE satisfies relay selection criterion.</p>
<p>For relay reselection, U2N Remote UE uses SL-RSRP measurements
towards the serving U2N Relay UE for relay reselection trigger
evaluation when there is data transmission from U2N Relay UE to U2N
Remote UE, and it is left to UE implementation whether to use SL-RSRP or
SD-RSRP for relay reselection trigger evaluation in case of no data
transmission from U2N Relay UE to U2N Remote UE.</p>
<p>A U2N Relay UE is considered suitable by a U2N Remote UE in terms of
radio criteria if the PC5 link quality measured by U2N Remote UE towards
the U2N Relay UE exceeds configured threshold (pre-configured or
provided by gNB). The U2N Remote UE searches for suitable U2N Relay UE
candidates that meet all AS layer and higher layer criteria (see TS
23.304 [48]). If there are multiple such suitable U2N Relay UEs, it is
up to U2N Remote UE implementation to choose one U2N Relay UE among
them. For L2 U2N Relay (re)selection, the PLMN ID and cell ID can be
used as additional AS criteria.</p>
<p>The U2N Remote UE triggers U2N Relay selection in following
cases:</p>
<p>- Direct Uu signal strength of current serving cell of the U2N Remote
UE is below a configured signal strength threshold;</p>
<p>- Indicated by upper layer of the U2N Remote UE.</p>
<p>The U2N Remote UE may trigger U2N Relay reselection in following
cases:</p>
<p>- PC5 signal strength of current U2N Relay UE is below a
(pre)configured signal strength threshold;</p>
<p>- Cell reselection, handover, Uu RLF, or Uu RRC connection
establishment/resume failure has been indicated by U2N Relay UE via
PC5-RRC signalling;</p>
<p>- When U2N Remote UE receives a PC5-S link release message from U2N
Relay UE;</p>
<p>- When U2N Remote UE detects PC5 RLF;</p>
<p>- Indicated by upper layer.</p>
<p>For L2 U2N Remote UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE and L3 U2N Remote
UEs, the cell (re)selection procedure and relay (re)selection procedure
run independently. If both suitable cells and suitable U2N Relay UEs are
available, it is up to the U2N Remote UE implementation to select either
a cell or a U2N Relay UE. A L3 U2N Remote UE may select a cell and a L3
U2N Relay UE simultaneously and this is up to implementation of L3 U2N
Remote UE.</p>
<p>For both L2 and L3 U2N Relay UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the
PC5-RRC message(s) are used to inform their connected U2N Remote UE(s)
when U2N Relay UEs select a new cell. The PC5-RRC message(s) are also
used to inform their connected L2 or L3 U2N Remote UE(s) when L2 or L3
U2N Relay UE performs handover, detects Uu RLF, or its Uu RRC connection
establishment/resume fails. Upon reception of the PC5 RRC message for
notification, it is up to U2N Remote UE implementation whether to
release or keep the unicast PC5 link. If U2N Remote UE decides to
release the unicast PC5 link, it triggers the PC5 release procedure and
may perform cell or relay reselection.</p>

procedures for L2 U2N Relay</h3>
<h4 id="rrc-connection-management">16.12.5.1 RRC Connection
Management</h4>
<p>The L2 U2N Remote UE needs to establish its own PDU sessions/DRBs
with the network before user plane data transmission.</p>
<p>The NR sidelink PC5 unicast link establishment procedures can be used
to setup a secure unicast link between L2 U2N Remote UE and L2 U2N Relay
UE before L2 U2N Remote UE establishes a Uu RRC connection with the
network via L2 U2N Relay UE.</p>
<p>The establishment of Uu SRB1/SRB2 and DRB of the L2 U2N Remote UE is
subject to Uu configuration procedures for L2 UE-to-Network Relay.</p>
<p>The following high level connection establishment procedure in Figure
16.12.5.1-1 applies to a L2 U2N Relay and L2 U2N Remote UE:</p>
<p><img src="media/image82.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.12.5.1-1: Procedure for L2 U2N Remote UE connection
establishment</p>
<p>1. The L2 U2N Remote and L2 U2N Relay UE perform discovery procedure,
and establish a PC5-RRC connection using the NR sidelink PC5 unicast
link establishment procedure.</p>
<p>2. The L2 U2N Remote UE sends the first RRC message (i.e.,
<em>RRCSetupRequest</em>) for its connection establishment with gNB via
the L2 U2N Relay UE, using a specified PC5 Relay RLC channel
configuration. The L2 U2N Relay UE sends the
<em>SidelinkUEInformationNR</em> message to request for the dedicated
configurations required to support the relay operation for the L2 U2N
Remote UE. If the L2 U2N Relay UE is not in RRC_CONNECTED, it needs to
do its own Uu RRC connection establishment upon reception of a message
on the specified PC5 Relay RLC channel. After L2 U2N Relay UE's RRC
connection establishment procedure and sending the
<em>SidelinkUEInformationNR</em> message, gNB configures SRB0 relaying
Uu Relay RLC channel to the U2N Relay UE. The gNB responds with an
<em>RRCSetup</em> message to L2 U2N Remote UE. The <em>RRCSetup</em>
message is sent to the L2 U2N Remote UE using SRB0 relaying Uu Relay RLC
channel over Uu and a specified PC5 Relay RLC channel over PC5.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Void.</p>
<p>3. The gNB and L2 U2N Relay UE perform relaying channel setup
procedure over Uu. According to the configuration from gNB, the L2 U2N
Relay/Remote UE establishes a PC5 Relay RLC channel for relaying of SRB1
towards the L2 U2N Remote/Relay UE over PC5.</p>
<p>4. The <em>RRCSetupComplete</em> message is sent by the L2 U2N Remote
UE to the gNB via the L2 U2N Relay UE using SRB1 relaying channel over
PC5 and SRB1 relaying channel configured to the L2 U2N Relay UE over Uu.
Then the L2 U2N Remote UE is as in RRC_CONNECTED with the gNB.</p>
<p>5. The L2 U2N Remote UE and gNB establish security following the Uu
security mode procedure and the security messages are forwarded through
the L2 U2N Relay UE.</p>
<p>6. The gNB sends an <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to the L2 U2N
Remote UE via the L2 U2N Relay UE, to setup the end-to-end SRB2/DRBs of
the L2 U2N Remote UE. The L2 U2N Remote UE sends an
<em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em> message to the gNB via the L2 U2N
Relay UE as a response. In addition, the gNB may configure additional Uu
Relay RLC channels between the gNB and L2 U2N Relay UE, and PC5 Relay
RLC channels between L2 U2N Relay UE and L2 U2N Remote UE for the
relaying traffic.</p>
<h4 id="radio-link-failure-1">16.12.5.2 Radio Link Failure</h4>
<p>The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED suspends Uu RLM (as described
in clause 9.2.7) when connected to the gNB via a L2 U2N Relay UE.</p>
<p>The L2 U2N Relay UE declares Uu Radio Link Failure (RLF) following
the same criteria as described in clause 9.2.7.</p>
<p>After Uu RLF is declared, the L2 U2N Relay UE takes the following
action on top of the actions described in clause 9.2.7:</p>
<p>- a PC5-RRC message can be used for sending an indication to its
connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s), which may trigger RRC connection
re-establishment for L2 U2N Remote UE; or</p>
<p>- indicating to upper layer to trigger PC5 unicast link release.</p>
<p>Upon detecting PC5 RLF, the L2 U2N Remote UE may trigger RRC
connection re-establishment.</p>
<h4 id="rrc-connection-re-establishment">16.12.5.3 RRC Connection

initiates RRC re-establishment procedure towards a suitable cell;</p>
<p>- If only suitable L2 U2N Relay UE(s) are available, the L2 U2N
Remote UE initiates RRC re-establishment procedure towards a suitable

<h4 id="rrc-connection-resume">16.12.5.4 RRC Connection Resume</h4>
<p>The RRC connection resume procedure described in clause 9.2.2 is
applied to L2 U2N Remote UE.</p>
<h4 id="system-information">16.12.5.5 System Information</h4>
<p>The in-coverage L2 U2N Remote UE is allowed to acquire any necessary
SIB(s) over Uu interface irrespective of its PC5 connection to L2 U2N
Relay UE. The L2 U2N Remote UE can also receive the system information
from the L2 U2N Relay UE after PC5 connection establishment with L2 U2N
Relay UE.</p>
<p>The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED can use the on-demand SIB
framework as specified in TS 38.331 [12] to request the SIB(s) via L2
U2N Relay UE. The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE can
inform L2 U2N Relay UE of its requested SIB type(s) via PC5-RRC message.
Then, L2 U2N Relay UE triggers on-demand SI/SIB acquisition procedure as
specified in TS38.331 [12] according to its own RRC state (if needed)
and sends the acquired SI(s)/SIB(s) to L2 U2N Remote UE via PC5-RRC
message.</p>
<p>Any SIB that the RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE L2 U2N Remote UE has a
requirement to use (e.g., for relay purpose) can be requested by the L2
U2N Remote UE (from the L2 U2N Relay UE or the network). For SIBs that
have been requested by the L2 U2N Remote UE from the L2 U2N Relay UE,
the L2 U2N Relay UE forwards them again in case of any update for
requested SIB(s). In case of RRC_CONNECTED L2 U2N Remote UE(s), it is
the responsibility of the network to send updated SIB(s) to L2 U2N
Remote UE(s) when they are updated. The L2 U2N Remote UE de-configures
SI request with L2 U2N Relay UE when entering into RRC_CONNECTED
state.</p>
<p>For SIB1 forwarding, for L2 U2N Remote UE, both request-based
delivery (i.e., SIB1 request by the U2N Remote UE) and unsolicited
forwarding are supported by L2 U2N Relay UE, of which the usage is left
to L2 U2N Relay UE implementation. If SIB1 changes, for L2 U2N Remote UE
in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the L2 U2N Relay UE always forwards
SIB1.</p>
<p>For the L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the short
message over Uu interface is not forwarded by the L2 U2N Relay UE to the
L2 U2N Remote UE. The L2 U2N Relay UE can forward PWS SIBs to its
connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s).</p>
<p>RAN sharing is supported for L2 U2N Relay UE. In particular, the L2
U2N Relay UE may forward, via discovery message, cell access related
information before the establishment of a PC5-RRC connection.</p>
<h4 id="paging-2">16.12.5.6 Paging</h4>
<p>When both L2 U2N Relay UE and L2 U2N Remote UE are in RRC IDLE or RRC
INACTIVE, the L2 U2N Relay UE monitors paging occasions of its connected
L2 U2N Remote UE(s). When a L2 U2N Relay UE needs to monitor paging for
a L2 U2N Remote UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE should monitor all POs of the L2
U2N Remote UE.</p>
<p>When L2 U2N Relay UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and L2 U2N Remote UE(s) is
in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, there are two options for paging
delivery:</p>
<p>- The L2 U2N Relay UE monitors POs of its connected L2 U2N Remote
UE(s) if the active DL BWP of the L2 U2N Relay UE is configured with
common search space including paging search space;</p>
<p>- The delivery of the L2 U2N Remote UE's paging can be performed
through a dedicated RRC message from the gNB to the L2 U2N Relay UE. The
dedicated RRC message for delivering L2 U2N Remote UE paging to the
RRC_CONNECTED L2 U2N Relay UE may contain one or more Remote UE IDs
(5G-S-TMSI or I-RNTI).</p>
<p>It is up to network implementation to decide which of the above two
options to use. The L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_CONNECTED, if configured with
paging search space, can determine whether to monitor POs for a L2 U2N
Remote UE based on the indication within the PC5-RRC signalling received
from the L2 U2N Remote UE.</p>
<p>The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE provides 5G-S-TMSI and UE specific
DRX cycle (if configured by upper layer) to the L2 U2N Relay UE for
requesting to perform PO monitoring. The L2 U2N Remote UE in
RRC_INACTIVE provides the minimum value of two UE specific DRX cycles
(if configured respectively by upper layer and NG-RAN), 5G-S-TMSI and
I-RNTI to the L2 U2N Relay UE for PO monitoring. The L2 U2N Relay UE in
RRC_CONNECTED can notify the L2 U2N Remote UE information (i.e.
5G-S-TMSI/I-RNTI) to the gNB via the <em>SidelinkUEInformationNR</em>
message for paging delivery purpose. The L2 U2N Relay UE receives paging
messages to check the 5G-S-TMSI/I-RNTI and sends relevant paging record
to the L2 U2N Remote UE accordingly.</p>
<p>The L2 U2N Relay UE uses unicast signalling to send paging to the L2
U2N Remote UE via PC5.</p>
<h4 id="access-control-2">16.12.5.7 Access Control</h4>
<p>The L2 U2N Remote UE performs unified access control as defined in TS
38.331 [12]. The L2 U2N Relay UE does not perform UAC for L2 U2N Remote
UE's data.</p>
<h4 id="mobility-registration-update-and-ran-area-update">16.12.5.8
Mobility Registration Update and RAN Area Update</h4>
<p>The L2 U2N Remote UE performs Mobility Registration Update/RNAU based
on the L2 U2N Relay UE's serving cell when it is connected with the L2
U2N Relay UE. A L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE initiates
Mobility Registration Update/RNAU procedure if the serving cell changes
(due to cell change by the L2 U2N Relay UE) and the new serving cell is
outside of the L2 U2N Remote UE's configured RNA/TA.</p>

for L2 U2N relay</h3>
<h4 id="general-22">16.12.6.0 General</h4>
<p>The service continuity procedure is applicable only for the mobility
cases of path switch from indirect to direct path, and from direct to
indirect path when the L2 U2N Remote UE and L2 U2N Relay UE belong to
the same gNB.</p>
<h4 id="switching-from-indirect-to-direct-path">16.12.6.1 Switching from
indirect to direct path</h4>
<p>For service continuity of L2 U2N Relay, the following procedure is
used, in case of L2 U2N Remote UE switching to direct path:</p>
<p><img src="media/image83.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.12.6.1-1: Procedure for L2 U2N Remote UE switching to
direct Uu cell</p>
<p>1. The Uu measurement configuration and measurement report signalling
procedures are performed to evaluate both relay link measurement and Uu
link measurement. The measurement results from L2 U2N Remote UE are
reported when configured measurement reporting criteria are met. The
sidelink relay measurement report shall include at least L2 U2N Relay
UE's source L2 ID, serving cell ID (i.e., NCGI/NCI), and sidelink
measurement quantity result. The sidelink measurement quantity can be
SL-RSRP of the serving L2 U2N Relay UE, and if SL-RSRP is not available,
SD-RSRP is used.</p>
<p>2. The gNB decides to switch the L2 U2N Remote UE onto direct Uu
path.</p>
<p>3. The gNB sends the <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to the L2
U2N Remote UE. The L2 U2N Remote UE stops User Plane and Control Plane
transmission via the L2 U2N Relay UE after reception of the
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message with the path switch
configuration.</p>
<p>4. The L2 U2N Remote UE synchronizes with the gNB and performs Random
Access.</p>
<p>5. The UE (i.e., L2 U2N Remote UE in previous steps) sends the
<em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em> message to the gNB via the direct
path, using the configuration provided in the
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message. From this step, the UE (i.e., L2
U2N Remote UE in previous steps) uses the RRC connection via the direct
path to the gNB.</p>
<p>6. The gNB sends the <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to the L2
U2N Relay UE to reconfigure the connection between the L2 U2N Relay UE
and the gNB. The <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to the L2 U2N Relay
UE can be sent any time after step 3 based on gNB implementation (e.g.,
to release Uu Relay RLC Channel and PC5 Relay RLC channel configuration
for relaying, and bearer mapping configuration related to the L2 U2N
Remote UE).</p>
<p>7. Either L2 U2N Relay UE or L2 U2N Remote UE's AS layer indicates
upper layers to release PC5 unicast link after receiving the
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message from the gNB. The timing to execute
link release is up to UE implementation.</p>
<p>8. The data path is switched from indirect path to direct path
between the UE (i.e., previous L2 U2N Remote UE) and the gNB. The PDCP
re-establishment or PDCP data recovery in uplink is performed by the UE
(i.e., previous L2 U2N Remote UE) for lossless delivery during path
switch if gNB configures it.</p>
<p>NOTE: Step 8 can be executed any time after step 4. Step 8 is
independent of step 6 and step 7.</p>
<h4 id="switching-from-direct-to-indirect-path">16.12.6.2 Switching from
direct to indirect path</h4>
<p>The gNB can select a L2 U2N Relay UE in any RRC state i.e., RRC_IDLE,
RRC_INACTIVE, or RRC_CONNECTED, as a target L2 U2N Relay UE for direct
to indirect path switch.</p>
<p>For service continuity of L2 U2N Remote UE, the following procedure
is used, in case of the L2 U2N Remote UE switching to indirect path via
a L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_CONNECTED:</p>
<p><img src="media/image84.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.12.6.2-1: Procedure for L2 U2N Remote UE switching to
indirect path via a L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_CONNECTED</p>
<p>1. The L2 U2N Remote UE reports one or multiple candidate L2 U2N
Relay UE(s) and Uu measurements, after it measures/discovers the
candidate L2 U2N Relay UE(s):</p>
<p>- The L2 U2N Remote UE filters the appropriate L2 U2N Relay UE(s)
according to relay selection criteria before reporting. The L2 U2N
Remote UE shall report only the L2 U2N Relay UE candidate(s) that fulfil
the higher layer criteria;</p>
<p>- The reporting includes at least a L2 U2N Relay UE ID, a L2 U2N
Relay UE' s serving cell ID, and a sidelink measurement quantity
information. SD-RSRP is used as sidelink measurement quantity.</p>
<p>2. The gNB decides to switch the L2 U2N Remote UE to a target L2 U2N
Relay UE. Then the gNB sends an <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to
the target L2 U2N Relay UE, which includes at least the L2 U2N Remote
UE's local ID and L2 ID, Uu Relay RLC channel and PC5 Relay RLC channel
configuration for relaying, and bearer mapping configuration.</p>
<p>3. The gNB sends the <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to the L2
U2N Remote UE. The <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message includes at least
the L2 U2N Relay UE ID, Remote UE's local ID, PC5 Relay RLC channel
configuration for relay traffic and the associated end-to-end Uu radio
bearer(s). The L2 U2N Remote UE stops User Plane and Control Plane
transmission over the direct path after reception of the
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message from the gNB.</p>
<p>4. The L2 U2N Remote UE establishes PC5 RRC connection with target L2
U2N Relay UE.</p>
<p>5. The L2 U2N Remote UE completes the path switch procedure by
sending the <em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em> message to the gNB via
the L2 U2N Relay UE.</p>
<p>6. The data path is switched from direct path to indirect path
between the L2 U2N Remote UE and the gNB.</p>
<p>In case the selected L2 U2N Relay UE for direct to indirect path
switch is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, after receiving the path switch
command, the L2 U2N Remote UE establishes a PC5 link with the L2 U2N
Relay UE and sends the <em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em> message via
the L2 U2N Relay UE, which triggers the L2 U2N Relay UE to enter
RRC_CONNECTED state. The procedure for L2 U2N Remote UE switching to
indirect path in Figure 16.12.6.2-1 can be also applied for the case
that the selected L2 U2N Relay UE for direct to indirect path switch is
in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE with the exception that the
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message is sent from the gNB to the L2 U2N
Relay UE after the L2 U2N Relay UE enters RRC_CONNECTED state, which
happens during step 5.</p>
<h2 id="support-of-reduced-capability-redcap-nr-devices">16.13 Support
of Reduced Capability (RedCap) NR devices</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">16.13.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>A RedCap UE has reduced capabilities with the intention to have lower
complexity with respect to non-RedCap UEs. It is mandatory for a RedCap
UE to support 20 MHz maximum UE channel bandwidth in FR1 and 100 MHz in
FR2.</p>
<h3 id="capabilities">16.13.2 Capabilities</h3>
<p>CA, MR-DC, DAPS, CPA, CPC and IAB related capabilities are not
supported by RedCap UEs, as defined together with other limitations in
TS 38.306 [11]. It is up to the network to prevent RedCap UEs from using
radio capabilities not intended for RedCap UEs.</p>
<h3 id="identification-access-and-camping-restrictions">16.13.3
Identification, access and camping restrictions</h3>
<p>A RedCap UE can be identified by the network during Random Access
procedure via MSG3/MSGA from a RedCap specific LCID(s) and optionally
via MSG1/MSGA (PRACH occasion or PRACH preamble). For RedCap UE
identification via MSG1/MSGA, RedCap specific Random Access
configuration may be configured by the network. For MSG3/MSGA, a RedCap
UE is identified by the dedicated LCID(s) indicated for CCCH
identification (CCCH or CCCH1) regardless whether RedCap specific Random
Access configuration is configured by the network.</p>
<p>RedCap UEs with 1 Rx branch and 2 Rx branches can be allowed
separately via system information. In addition, RedCap UEs in
Half-Duplex FDD mode can be allowed via system information. A RedCap
specific IFRI can be provided in SIB1, when absent, RedCap UEs access is
not allowed. Information on which frequencies RedCap UE access is
allowed can be provided in system information.</p>
<p>A RedCap UE with 1 Rx branch applies the associated offset for
broadcasted cell specific RSRP thresholds for random access, SDT, cell
edge condition and cell (re)selection criterion as specified in TS
38.133 [13].</p>
<p>NOTE: It is up to the E-UTRA network, if possible, to avoid handover
attempts of a RedCap UE to a target NR cell not supporting RedCap as
specified in TS 36.300 [2]. It is up to the RedCap UE implementation, if
possible, to recover from handover attempts to a target NR cell not
supporting RedCap.</p>
<h3 id="rrm-measurement-relaxations">16.13.4 RRM measurement
relaxations</h3>
<p>RRM measurement relaxation is enabled and disabled by the network. In
RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE a RedCap UE is allowed to relax neighbour cell
RRM measurements when the stationary criterion is met or when both
stationary criterion and not-at-cell-edge criterion are met. Network may
configure stationary criterion for a RedCap UE in RRC_CONNECTED and the
UE reports its RRM measurement relaxation fulfilment status using UE
Assistance Information when the stationarity criterion is met or no
longer met.</p>
<h3 id="bwp-operation">16.13.5 BWP operation</h3>
<p>A RedCap UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE monitors paging only in an
initial BWP (default or RedCap specific) associated with CD-SSB and
performs cell (re-)selection and related measurements on the CD-SSB. If
a RedCap-specific initial UL BWP is configured and NUL is selected,
RedCap UEs shall use only the RedCap-specific initial UL BWP to perform
RACH procedure in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE or to perform CG-SDT
procedure (as described in clause 18.0) in RRC_INACTIVE.</p>
<p>A RedCap UE may be configured with multiple NCD-SSBs provided that
each BWP is configured with at most one SSB. NCD-SSB may be configured
for a RedCap UE in RRC_CONNECTED to perform RLM, BFD, and RRM
measurements and RA resource selection when the active BWP does not
contain CD-SSB.</p>
<p>A RedCap UE may be configured with NCD-SSB for a RedCap-specific
initial DL BWP to perform SDT procedure in RRC_INACTIVE (as described in
clause 18.0) in case the RedCap-specific initial DL BWP does not contain
CD-SSB.</p>

<h3 id="overview-10">16.14.1 Overview</h3>
<p>Figure 16.14.1-1 below illustrates an example of a Non-Terrestrial
Network (NTN) providing non-terrestrial NR access to the UE by means of
an NTN payload and an NTN Gateway, depicting a service link between the
NTN payload and a UE, and a feeder link between the NTN Gateway and the
NTN payload.</p>
<p><img src="media/image85.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 16.14.1-1: Overall illustration of an NTN</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Figure 16.14.1-1 illustrates an NTN; RAN4 aspects are out of
scope.</p>
<p>The NTN payload transparently forwards the radio protocol received
from the UE (via the service link) to the NTN Gateway (via the feeder
link) and vice-versa. The following connectivity is supported by the NTN
payload:</p>
<p>- An NTN gateway may serve multiple NTN payloads;</p>
<p>- An NTN payload may be served by multiple NTN gateways.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: In this release, the NTN-payload may change the carrier
frequency, before re-transmitting it on the service link, and vice versa
(respectively on the feeder link).</p>
<p>For NTN, the following applies in addition to Network Identities as
described in clause 8.2:</p>
<p>- A Tracking Area corresponds to a fixed geographical area. Any
respective mapping is configured in the RAN;</p>
<p>- A Mapped Cell ID as specified in clause 16.14.5.</p>
<p>NTN can be deployed to provide coverage with earth-moving cell,
quasi-earth-fixed cell and earth-fixed cell which are supported
respectively by the following three types of service links:</p>
<p>- Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) continuously covering the same
geographical areas all the time (e.g., the case of GSO satellites);</p>
<p>- Quasi-Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) covering one geographic
area for a limited period and a different geographic area during another
period (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating steerable
beams);</p>
<p>- Earth-moving: provisioned by beam(s) whose coverage area slides
over the Earth surface (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating
fixed or non-steerable beams).</p>
<p>With NGSO satellites, the gNB can provide either quasi-Earth-fixed
service link or Earth-moving service link, while gNB operating with GSO
satellite can provide Earth fixed service link or quasi-Earth-fixed
service link.</p>
<p>In this release, the UE supporting NTN is GNSS-capable.</p>
<p>In NTN, the distance refers to Euclidean distance.</p>

<p>DL and UL are frame aligned at the uplink time synchronization
reference point (RP) with an offset given by N<sub>TA,offset</sub> (see
clause 4.2 of TS 38.213 [38]).</p>
<p>To accommodate the propagation delay in NTNs, several timing
relationships are enhanced by a Common Timing Advance (Common TA) and
two offsets <span class="math inline">\(K_{offset}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(k_{mac}\)</span>:</p>
<p>- <span class="math inline">\(Common\ TA\)</span> is a configured
timing offset that is equal to the RTT between the RP and the NTN
payload.</p>
<p>- <span class="math inline">\(K_{offset}\)</span> is a configured
scheduling offset that needs to be larger or equal to the sum of the
service link RTT and the Common TA.</p>
<p>- <span class="math inline">\(k_{mac}\ \)</span>is a configured
offset that is approximately equal to the RTT between the RP and the
gNB.</p>
<p>The scheduling offset <span class="math inline">\(K_{offset}\)</span>
is used to allow the UE sufficient processing time between a downlink
reception and an uplink transmission, see TS 38.213 [38].</p>
<p>The offset <span class="math inline">\(k_{mac}\)</span> is used to
delay the application of a downlink configuration indicated by a MAC CE
command on PDSCH, see TS 38.213 [38], and in estimation of UE-gNB RTT,
see TS 38.321 [6]. It may be provided by the network when downlink and
uplink frame timing are not aligned at gNB. The <span
class="math inline">\(k_{mac}\)</span> is also used in the random access
procedure, to determine the start time of RAR window/MsgB window after a
Msg1/MsgA transmission (see TS 38.213 [38]).</p>
<p>The Service link RTT, Feeder link RTT, RP, Common TA, <span

<p>The network may configure the HARQ operation as follows:</p>
<p>- For downlink, HARQ feedback can be enabled or disabled per HARQ
process (as specified in clause 5.3.2.2 and clause 5.7 of TS 38.321
[6]). Disabling HARQ feedback allows scheduling a HARQ process before
one HARQ RTT has elapsed since last scheduled.</p>
<p>- For uplink, HARQ mode (i.e. HARQ mode A or HARQ mode B) can be
configured per HARQ process (as specified in clause 5.4.3.1 and clause
5.7 of TS 38.321 [6]). HARQ mode B allows scheduling a HARQ process
before one HARQ RTT has elapsed since last scheduled.</p>
<p>NOTE: For the HARQ processes configured with HARQ feedback
enabled/disabled, it is up to network implementation to ensure a proper
configuration of HARQ feedback (e.g., either all enabled or all
disabled) for HARQ processes used by an SPS configuration. For the HARQ
processes configured with HARQ mode, it is up to network implementation
to ensure a proper configuration of HARQ mode (e.g., either all HARQ
mode A or all HARQ mode B) for HARQ processes used by a CG
configuration.</p>

cell, the UE shall compute the RTT between UE and the RP based on the
GNSS position, the ephemeris, and the Common TA parameters (see clause

T<sub>TA</sub> for the RTT between the UE and the RP as illustrated in
Figure 16.14.2.1-1 (see clause 4.3 of TS 38.211 [52]).</p>
<p>The UE shall compute the frequency Doppler shift of the service link,
and autonomously pre-compensate for it in the uplink transmissions, by
considering UE position and the ephemeris. If the UE does not have a
valid GNSS position and/or valid ephemeris and Common TA, it shall not
transmit until both are regained.</p>
<p>In connected mode, the UE shall be able to continuously update the
Timing Advance and frequency pre-compensation.</p>
<p>The UE may be configured to report Timing Advance during Random
Access procedures or in connected mode. In connected mode,
event-triggered reporting of the Timing Advance is supported.</p>

<h4 id="definitions-2">16.14.4.1 Definitions</h4>
<p>A feeder link switchover is the procedure where the feeder link is
changed from a source NTN Gateway to a target NTN Gateway for a specific
NTN payload. The feeder link switchover is a Transport Network Layer
procedure. Service link switch refers to a change of the serving NTN
payload.</p>
<p>Both hard and soft feeder link switchover are supported in NTN.</p>
<h4 id="assumptions">16.14.4.2 Assumptions</h4>
<p>A feeder link switch over may result in transferring the established
connection for the affected UEs between two gNBs.</p>
<p>For soft feeder link switch over, an NTN payload is able to connect
to more than one NTN Gateway during a given period, i.e. a temporary
overlap can be ensured during the transition between the feeder
links.</p>
<p>For hard feeder link switch over, an NTN payload connects to only one
NTN Gateway at any given time, i.e. a radio link interruption may occur
during the transition between the feeder links.</p>
<h4 id="procedures">16.14.4.3 Procedures</h4>
<p>The NTN Control function (see Annex B.4) determines the point in time
when the feeder link switch over between two gNBs is performed. The
transfer of the affected UE(s)' context between the two gNBs at feeder
link switch over is performed by means of either NG based or Xn based
handover, and it depends on the gNBs' implementation and configuration
information provided to the gNBs by the NTN Control function.</p>

allow the identification of the correct target cells for RAN paging.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The Cell Identity used for RAN Paging is assumed to typically
represent a Uu Cell ID.</p>
<p>The mapping between Mapped Cell IDs and geographical areas is
configured in the RAN and Core Network.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: A specific geographical location may be mapped to multiple
Mapped Cell ID(s), and such Mapped Cell IDs may be configured to
indicate differerent geographical areas (e.g. overlapping and/or with
different dimensions).</p>
<p>The gNB is responsible for constructing the Mapped Cell ID based on
the UE location information received from the UE, if available. The
mapping may be pre-configured (e.g., up to operator's policy) or up to
implementation.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: As described in TS 23.501 [3], the User Location Information
may enable the AMF to determine whether the UE is allowed to operate at
its present location. Special Mapped Cell IDs or TACs may be used to
indicate areas outside the serving PLMN's country.</p>
<p>The gNB reports the broadcasted TAC(s) of the selected PLMN to the
AMF as part of ULI. In case the gNB knows the UE's location information,
the gNB may determine the TAI the UE is currently located in and provide
that TAI to the AMF as part of ULI.</p>

<h1 id="interference-management">17 Interference Management</h1>
<h2 id="remote-interference-management">17.1 Remote Interference
Management</h2>
<p>The atmospheric ducting phenomenon, caused by lower densities at
higher altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere, causes a reduced refractive
index, causing the signals to bend back towards the Earth. A signal
trapped in the atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than
normal. In TDD networks with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in
the absence of atmospheric ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the
interference between UL and DL transmissions in different cells.
However, when the atmospheric ducting phenomenon happens, radio signals
can travel a relatively long distance, and the propagation delay exceeds
the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals of an aggressor cell can
interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that is far away from the
aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote interference. The
further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols of the
victim will be impacted.</p>
<p>A remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and
aggressor cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management
(RIM) coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and
victim gNBs can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is
assigned a set ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal
(RIM-RS) and the radio resources associated with the set ID. Each
aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs and each victim
gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas each cell can have
at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID. Consequently, each
gNB can be an aggressor and a victim at the same time.</p>
<p>To mitigate remote interference, the network enables RIM frameworks
for coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs. The coordination
communication in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. The
backhaul-based RIM framework uses a combination of wireless and backhaul
communication, while in the wireless framework, the communication is
purely wireless.</p>
<p>In both frameworks, all gNBs in a victim set simultaneously transmit
an identical RIM reference signal carrying the victim set ID over the
air.</p>
<p>In the wireless framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal
from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and send
back a RIM reference signal carrying the aggressor set ID. The RIM
reference signal sent by the aggressor is able to provide information
whether the atmospheric ducting phenomenon exists. The victim gNBs
realize the atmospheric ducting phenomenon have ceased upon not
receiving any reference signal sent from aggressors.</p>
<p>In the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference
signal from the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and
establish backhaul coordination towards the victim gNB set. The backhaul
messages are sent from individual aggressor gNBs to individual victim
gNB, where the signalling is transparent to the core network. The RIM
backhaul messages from aggressor to victim gNBs carry the indication
about the detection or disappearance of RIM reference signal. Based on
the indication from the backhaul message, the victim gNBs realize
whether the atmospheric ducting and the consequent remote interference
have ceased.</p>
<p>In both frameworks, upon realizing that the atmospheric ducting has
disappeared, the victim gNBs stop transmitting the RIM reference
signal.</p>
<h2 id="cross-link-interference-management">17.2 Cross-Link Interference
Management</h2>
<p>When different TDD DL/UL patterns are used between neighbouring
cells, UL transmission in one cell may interfere with DL reception in
another cell: this is referred to as Cross Link Interference (CLI).</p>
<p>To mitigate CLI, gNBs can exchange and coordinate their intended TDD
DL-UL configurations over Xn and F1 interfaces; and the victim UEs can
be configured to perform CLI measurements. There are two types of CLI
measurements:</p>
<p>- SRS-RSRP measurement in which the UE measures SRS-RSRP over SRS
resources of aggressor UE(s);</p>
<p>- CLI-RSSI measurement in which the UE measures the total received
power observed over RSSI resources.</p>
<p>Layer 3 filtering applies to CLI measurement results and both event
triggered and periodic reporting are supported.</p>
<h1 id="small-data-transmission">18 Small Data Transmission</h1>
<h2 id="general-23">18.0 General</h2>
<p>Small Data Transmission (SDT) is a procedure allowing data and/or
signalling transmission while remaining in RRC_INACTIVE state (i.e.
without transitioning to RRC_CONNECTED state). SDT is enabled on a radio
bearer basis and is initiated by the UE only if less than or equal to a
configured amount of UL data awaits transmission across all radio
bearers for which SDT is enabled, the DL RSRP is above a configured
threshold, and a valid SDT resource is available as specified in clause
5.27.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. Maximum duration the SDT procedure can last is
dictated by a SDT failure detection timer that is configured by the
network (see clause 6.2.2 of TS 38.331 [12]).</p>
<p>SDT procedure is initiated with either a transmission over RACH
(configured via system information) or over Type 1 CG resources
(configured via dedicated signalling in <em>RRCRelease</em>). The SDT
resources can be configured on initial BWP for both RACH and CG. RACH
and CG resources for SDT can be configured on either or both of NUL and
SUL carriers. The CG resources for SDT are valid only within the PCell
of the UE when the <em>RRCRelease</em> with suspend indication is
received. CG resources are associated with one or multiple SSB(s). For
RACH, the network can configure 2-step and/or 4-step RA resources for
SDT. When both 2-step and 4-step RA resources for SDT are configured,
the UE selects the RA type according to clause 9.2.6. CFRA is not
supported for SDT over RACH.</p>
<p>Once initiated, the SDT procedure is either:</p>
<p>- successfully completed after the UE is directed to RRC_IDLE (via
<em>RRCRelease</em>) or to continue in RRC_INACTIVE (via <em>RRCRelease
or RRCReject</em>) or to RRC_CONNECTED (via <em>RRCResume or
RRCSetup</em>); or</p>
<p>- unsuccessfully completed upon cell re-selection, expiry of the SDT
failure detection timer, a MAC entity reaching a configured maximum
PRACH preamble transmission threshold, an RLC entity reaching a
configured maximum retransmission threshold, or integrity check failure
while SDT procedure is ongoing, or expiry of SDT-specific timing
alignment timer or <em>configuredGrantTimer</em> while SDT procedure is
ongoing over CG and the UE has not received a response from the network
after the initial PUSCH transmission.</p>
<p>Upon unsuccessful completion of the SDT procedure, the UE transitions
to RRC_IDLE.</p>
<p>For SDT, network should not send <em>RRCReject</em> in response to
<em>RRCResumeRequest/RRCResumeRequest1</em> if DL data over any radio
bearer configured for SDT is transmitted.</p>
<p>The initial PUSCH transmission during the SDT procedure includes at
least the CCCH message. When using CG resources for initial SDT
transmission, the UE can perform autonomous retransmission of the
initial transmission if the UE does not receive confirmation from the
network (dynamic UL grant or DL assignment) before a configured timer
expires as specified in clause 5.4.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. After the initial
PUSCH transmission, subsequent transmissions are handled differently
depending on the type of resource used to initiate the SDT
procedure:</p>
<p>- When using CG resources, the network can schedule subsequent UL
transmissions using dynamic grants or they can take place on the
following CG resource occasions. The DL transmissions are scheduled
using dynamic assignments. The UE can initiate subsequent UL
transmission only after reception of confirmation (dynamic UL grant or
DL assignment) for the initial PUSCH transmission from the network. For
subsequent UL transmission, the UE cannot initiate re-transmission over
a CG resource.</p>
<p>- When using RACH resources, the network can schedule subsequent UL
and DL transmissions using dynamic UL grants and DL assignments,
respectively, after the completion of the RA procedure.</p>
<p>When SDT procedure is initiated, AS security is applied for all the
radio bearers enabled for SDT as specified in clause 5.3.13.3 of TS
38.331 [12].</p>
<p>While the SDT procedure is ongoing, if data appears in a buffer of
any radio bearer not enabled for SDT, the UE initiates a transmission of
a non-SDT data arrival indication using <em>UEAssistanceInformation</em>
message to the network and, if available, includes the resume cause.</p>
<p>While the SDT procedure is ongoing and RA procedure is triggered
(e.g., upon UL data arrival as specified in clause 9.2.6), only the RACH
resources not configured for SDT can be used by the UE.</p>
<p>SDT procedure over CG resources can only be initiated with valid UL
timing alignment. The UL timing alignment is maintained by the UE based
on a SDT-specific timing alignment timer configured by the network via
dedicated signalling and, for initial CG-SDT transmission, also by DL
RSRP of configured number of highest ranked SSBs which are above a
configured RSRP threshold. Upon expiry of the SDT-specific timing
alignment timer, the CG resources are released while maintaining the CG
resource configuration.</p>
<p>Logical channel restrictions configured by the network while in
RRC_CONNECTED state and/or in <em>RRCRelease</em> message for radio
bearers enabled for SDT, if any, are applied by the UE during SDT
procedure.</p>
<p>The network may configure UE to apply ROHC continuity for SDT either
when the UE initiates SDT in the PCell of the UE when the
<em>RRCRelease</em> with suspend indication was received or when the UE
initiates SDT in a cell of its RNA.</p>
<h2 id="support-of-sdt-procedure-over-rach">18.1 Support of SDT
procedure over RACH</h2>
<p>For SDT procedure over RACH, if the UE accesses a gNB other than the
last serving gNB, the UL SDT data/signalling is buffered at the
receiving gNB, and then the receiving gNB triggers the XnAP Retrieve UE
Context procedure. The receiving gNB indicates SDT to the last serving
gNB and the last serving gNB decides whether to relocate the UE context
or not. Other SDT assistance information (e.g., single packet, multiple
packets) may also be provided by the receiving gNB to help the decision
of UE context relocation.</p>
<p>If the last serving gNB decides not to relocate the full UE context,
it transfers a partial UE context containing SDT RLC context information
necessary for the receiving gNB to handle SDT via the Partial UE Context
Transfer procedure.</p>
<p>Then, in case SDT is used for user data over DRBs, UL/DL tunnels are
established for DRBs configured for SDT between the receiving gNB and
the last serving gNB. The PDCP PDU of UL/DL data is transferred over the
tunnels, until the last serving gNB terminates the SDT session and
directs the UE to continue in RRC_INACTIVE by sending the
<em>RRCRelease</em> message.</p>
<p>Or in case SDT is used for signalling, SRB PDCP PDUs are transferred
between the receiving gNB and the last serving gNB via the XnAP RRC
Transfer procedure, until the last serving gNB terminates the SDT
session and directs the UE to continue in RRC_INACTIVE by sending the
<em>RRCRelease</em> message.</p>
<p>During the SDT session, in case the receiving gNB detects that no
more packets are to be transmitted, or radio link problem is detected,
the receiving gNB may also request to terminate the SDT session to the
last serving gNB via the UE Context Retrieve Confirmation procedure.</p>
<h2 id="sdt-with-ue-context-relocation">18.2 SDT with UE context

<p>Figure 18.2-1. RA-based SDT with UE context relocation</p>
<p>1. The UE sends an <em>RRCResumeRequest</em> as well as UL SDT data
and/or UL SDT signalling to the Receiving gNB.</p>
<p>2. The Receiving gNB identifies the Last Serving gNB using the I-RNTI
and retrieves the UE context by means of Xn-AP Retrieve UE Context
procedure. The Receiving gNB indicates that the UE request is for an SDT
and may also provide SDT assistance information (e.g., single packet,
multiple packets).</p>
<p>3. The Last Serving gNB decides to relocate UE context and responds
with the RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE message. The UL SDT data, if any,
is delivered from the Receiving gNB to the UPF.</p>
<p>4-6. The Receiving gNB decides to keep UE in RRC_INACTIVE state for
SDT. If loss of DL user data buffered in the Last Serving gNB shall be
prevented, the Receiving gNB provides forwarding addresses via the Xn-U
ADDRESS INDICATION message. The Receiving gNB also initiates NGAP Path
Switch Request procedure to establish a NG UE-associated signalling
connection to the AMF. After the Path Switch Request procedure, the
buffered UL NAS PDU, if any, is delivered from the Receiving gNB to the
AMF. And then, the subsequent UL/DL SDT data and/or signalling are
transferred between UE and core network via the Receiving gNB.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: If the UP policy received from the Last Serving gNB is
different from that received in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE
message, the Receiving gNB may either send the UE back to RRC_IDLE or
move the UE to RRC_CONNECTED to update the security configuration.</p>
<p>7. After the SDT transmission is terminated, the Receiving gNB
generates and sends the <em>RRCRelease</em> message including the
suspend indication to the UE to terminate the SDT procedure and continue
in RRC_INACTIVE state.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: In case DL non-SDT data or DL non-SDT signalling arrives, or
the UE assistance information (i.e. UL non-SDT data arrival indication)
is received from the UE, the Receiving gNB may decide to directly send
the UE to RRC_CONNECTED state by sending the <em>RRCResume</em>
message.</p>
<p>NOTE 3: The Receiving gNB may decide to directly send the UE to
RRC_CONNECTED state by sending the <em>RRCResume</em> message based on
(e.g. large size of) DL SDT data or DL SDT signalling.</p>
<p>NOTE 4: The Receiving gNB may decide to directly send the UE to
RRC_CONNECTED state by sending the <em>RRCResume</em> message based on
the BSR received from the UE in case of uplink SDT data exceeding the
uplink data size threshold.</p>
<p>8. The Receiving gNB indicates to the Last Serving gNB to remove the
UE context by sending the XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE message. The XnAP UE
CONTEXT RELEASE message can be sent after step 6.</p>

<p>5. The receiving gNB acknowledges receiving the partial UE context
and provides associated DL TNL address. The UE context is kept at the
last serving gNB and the SDT related RLC context is established at the
receiving gNB. Then UL/DL GTP-U tunnels are established for DRBs
configured for SDT, if any, and the UL SDT data and/or signalling, if
any, are forwarded to the last serving gNB, and then delivered to the
core network.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The DL signalling from the last serving gNB, if any, is
forwarded to the receiving gNB via the RRC TRANSFER message, for which
the receiving gNB delivers it to the UE.</p>
<p>NOTE 1a: In case DL non-SDT data or DL non-SDT signalling arrives, or
UE assistance information (i.e. UL non-SDT data arrival indication) is
received from the UE, the last serving gNB terminates the SDT procedure
and directs the UE to continue in RRC_INACTIVE state by sending the

<p>6. The receiving gNB detects the end of SDT session and sends the
RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT CONFIRM message including whether this is a "normal"
end of SDT transaction or a radio link problem.</p>
<p>7. Upon receiving the RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT CONFIRM message and
deciding to terminate the SDT, the last serving gNB responds to the

<p>- Enhanced aggregation of multiple slots with TB repetition is
supported for both PUSCH transmission with dynamic and configured grant.
In addition, counting based on available slots is supported. The maximum
number of aggregated slots for counting based on available slots and
counting based on physical slots are both 32.</p>
<p>- TB processing over multiple slots with and without repetition is
supported for both PUSCH transmission with dynamic grant and configured
grant. For a single transmission of TB processing over multiple slots
PUSCH, the TB size is determined based on multiple slots.</p>
<p>- DMRS bundling where the UE maintains phase continuity and power
consistency across PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions to enable
improved channel estimation is supported. Inter-slot frequency hopping
with DMRS bundling is supported.</p>
<p>- Dynamic PUCCH repetition factor indication configured per PUCCH
resource is introduced, applicable to all PUCCH formats.</p>
<p>- Aggregation of multiple slots with TB repetition for MSG3
transmission is supported on both NUL and SUL, applicable to CBRA with
4-step RA type. If configured, the UE requests MSG3 repetition via
separate RACH resources when the RSRP of DL path-loss reference is lower
than a configured threshold. BWP configured with RACH resources solely
for MSG3 repetition is also supported without the need to consider the

MUSIM device operation:</p>
<p>- Paging Collision Avoidance, as described in clause 20.2;</p>
<p>- UE notification on Network Switching, as described in clause
20.3;</p>
<h2 id="paging-collision-avoidance">20.2 Paging Collision Avoidance</h2>
<p>The purpose of paging collision avoidance is to address the overlap
of paging occasions on both USIMs when a MUSIM device (e.g. dual USIM
device) is in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE state in both the networks (e.g.
Network A and Network B) associated with respective USIMs. Network A is
NR and Network B is E-UTRA or NR.</p>
<p>A MUSIM device may determine potential paging collision on two
networks and may trigger actions to prevent potential paging collision
on NR network as specified in TS 23.501 [3].</p>
<p>NOTE: It is left to UE implementation as to how it selects one of the
two RATs/networks for paging collision avoidance.</p>
<h2 id="ue-notification-on-network-switching">20.3 UE notification on
Network Switching</h2>
<p>For MUSIM operation, a MUSIM device in RRC_CONNECTED state in Network
A may have to switch from Network A to Network B. Network A is NR and
Network B can either be E-UTRA or NR. Before switching from Network A, a
MUSIM device should notify Network A to either leave RRC_CONNECTED
state, or be kept in RRC_CONNECTED state in Network A while temporarily
switching to Network B.</p>
<p>When configured to do so, a MUSIM device can signal to the Network A
a preference to leave RRC_CONNECTED state by using RRC (see TS 38.331
[12]) or NAS signalling (see TS 23.501 [3]). After sending a preference
to leave RRC_CONNECTED state by using RRC signalling, if the MUSIM
device does not receive an <em>RRCRelease</em> message from the Network
A within a certain time period (configured by the Network A, see TS
38.331 [12]), the MUSIM device can enter RRC_IDLE state in Network
A.</p>
<p>When configured to do so, a MUSIM device can signal to the Network A
a preference to be temporarily switching to Network B while remaining in
RRC_CONNECTED state in Network. This is indicated by scheduling gaps
preference.This preference can include information for setup or release
of gap(s). The Network A can configure at most 4 gap patterns for MUSIM
purpose: three periodic gaps and a single aperiodic gap. The Network A
should always provide at least one of the requested gap pattern or no
gaps. Network providing an alternative gap pattern instead of the one
requested by the UE is not supported in this release.</p>
<h1 id="application-layer-measurement-collection">21 Application Layer
Measurement Collection</h1>
<h2 id="overview-11">21.1 Overview</h2>
<p>The QoE Measurement Collection function enables collection of
application layer measurements from the UE. The supported service types
are:</p>
<p>- QoE Measurement Collection for DASH streaming services;</p>
<p>- QoE Measurement Collection for MTSI services;</p>
<p>- QoE Measurement Collection for VR services.</p>
<p>The QoE measurement collection is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state
only. Both signalling based and management based QoE measurement
collection are supported.</p>
<p>NOTE: The naming QoE Measurement is used in NG, Xn, and interfaces
between the OAM and the gNB. In the Uu interface, the naming application
layer measurement is used and it is equal to QoE Measurement.</p>
<h2 id="qoe-measurement-configuration">21.2 QoE Measurement
Configuration</h2>
<h3 id="qoe-measurement-collection-activation-and-reporting">21.2.1 QoE
Measurement Collection Activation and Reporting</h3>
<p>The feature is activated in the gNB either by direct configuration
from the OAM system (management-based activation), or by signalling from
the OAM via the 5GC (signalling-based activation), containing
UE-associated QoE configuration. One or more QoE measurement collection
jobs can be activated at a UE per service type, and each QoE measurement
configuration is uniquely identified by a QoE reference. When the UE is
configured with MR-DC, only the MN can configure the QoE
configuration.</p>
<p>For signalling-based QoE measurements, the OAM initiates the QoE
measurement activation for a specific UE via the 5GC, and the gNB
receives one or more QoE measurement configurations by means of
UE-associated signalling. The QoE measurement configuration for
signalling-based activation includes an application layer measurement
configuration list and the corresponding information for QoE measurement
collection, e.g., QoE reference, service type, MCE IP address, slice
scope, area scope, MDT alignment information and the indication of
available RAN visible QoE metrics.</p>
<p>For management-based QoE measurement activation, the OAM sends one or
more QoE measurement configurations directly to the gNB. The QoE
measurement configuration for management-based activation also includes
an application layer measurement configuration list and the
corresponding information for QoE measurement collection. The gNB
selects UE(s) that meet the required QoE measurement capability, area
scope and slice scope.</p>
<p>Application layer measurement configuration received by the gNB from
OAM or 5GC is encapsulated in a transparent container, which is
forwarded to a UE as Application layer configuration in the
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message (there can be multiple
configurations in the same message). Application layer measurement
reports received from UE's application layer are encapsulated in a
transparent container and sent to the network in the
<em>MeasurementReportAppLayer</em> message, as specified in TS 38.331
[12]. The UE can send multiple application layer measurement reports to
the gNB in one <em>MeasurementReportAppLayer</em> message. In order to
allow the transmission of application layer measurement reports which
exceed the maximum PDCP SDU size, segmentation of the
<em>MeasurementReportAppLayer</em> message may be enabled by the gNB. A
measurement configuration application layer ID conveyed in the RRC
signalling is used to identify the application layer measurement
configuration and report between the gNB and the UE. The measurement
configuration application layer ID is mapped to the QoE reference in the
gNB, and the gNB forwards the application layer measurement report to
MCE together with the QoE reference. The gNB can release one or multiple
application layer measurement configurations from the UE in one
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message at any time. The UE may additionally
be configured by the gNB to report when a QoE measurement session starts
or stops for a certain application layer measurement configuration.</p>
<h3 id="qoe-measurement-collection-deactivation">21.2.2 QoE Measurement
Collection Deactivation</h3>
<p>The QoE Measurement Collection deactivation permanently stops all or
some of the QoE measurement collection jobs towards a UE, resulting in
the release of the corresponding QoE measurement configuration(s) in the
UE. The deactivation of QoE measurement collection is supported by using
UE-associated signalling. A list of QoE references is used to deactivate
the corresponding QoE measurement collection job(s).</p>
<p>Upon reception of the QoE release message in an application layer
measurement configuration, the UE discards any unsent application layer
measurement reports corresponding to the released application layer
configuration. The UE discards the reports received from application
layer when it has no associated application layer measurement
configuration configured.</p>
<p>The network can replace a QoE measurement configuration with another
one by deactivating an existing QoE measurement configuration and
activating another QoE measurement configuration of the same QoE
measurement configuration type.</p>
<h3 id="handling-of-qmc-during-ran-overload">21.2.3 Handling of QMC
during RAN Overload</h3>
<p>The QoE measurement collection pause/resume procedure is used to
pause/resume reporting of one or multiple QoE measurement configurations
in a UE in RAN overload situation.</p>
<p>The gNB can use the <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message to
temporarily stop the UE from sending application layer measurement
reports associated with one or multiple application layer measurement
configurations. When the UE receives the QoE measurement collection
pause indication, the UE temporarily stores application layer
measurement reports in AS layer. When the UE receives the QoE
measurement collection resume indication, the UE sends the stored
application layer measurement reports to the gNB.</p>
<h3
id="qoe-measurement-handling-in-rrc_idle-and-rrc_inactive-states">21.2.4
QoE Measurement Handling in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE States</h3>
<p>If the UE enters RRC_INACTIVE, the UE AS configuration for the QoE is
stored in the UE Inactive AS context.</p>
<p>If the UE enters RRC_IDLE state, the UE releases all application
layer measurement configurations.</p>
<h3 id="per-slice-qoe-measurement">21.2.5 Per-slice QoE Measurement</h3>
<p>When a service is provided within a configured slice, the QoE
Measurement for this service type can also be configured together with
the corresponding slice scope, so that the user experience of this
service can also be evaluated on a per-slice basis. Multiple QoE
measurement configurations can be configured for the same service type,
and each configuration can pertain to different slices, where each QoE
measurement configuration is identified with a QoE reference.</p>
<p>The UE includes the network slice identifier inside the QoE report
container when reporting QoE measurement reports.</p>
<h2 id="qoe-measurement-continuity-for-mobility">21.3 QoE Measurement
Continuity for Mobility</h2>
<p>QoE measurement collection continuity for intra-system intra-RAT
mobility is supported, with the Area Scope parameters configured by the
OAM, where the network is responsible for keeping track of whether the
UE is inside or outside the area scope. A UE continues an ongoing QoE
measurement even if it leaves the area scope, unless the network
indicates to the UE to release the application layer measurement
configuration.</p>
<p>For the RRC_CONNECTED state mobility, the source gNB may transmit the
information related to one or more application layer measurement
configurations of the UE to the target gNB via XnAP or NGAP. For
signalling-based QoE, the service type indication, QoE reference, and,
optionally, the MCE IP address, measurement configuration application
layer ID, MDT alignment information, area scope, slice support list for
QMC, available RAN visible QoE metrics and measurement status are passed
to the target gNB. For management-based QoE, the service type
indication, measurement configuration application layer ID, the MCE IP
address and QoE measurement status are passed to the target gNB. For
RRC_INACTIVE state mobility, QoE measurement configuration(s) of a
specific UE can be retrieved from the gNB hosting the UE context when it
resumes to the RRC_CONNECTED state.</p>
<p>For signalling-based QoE, at handover to a target gNB that supports
QoE measurement collection, the target gNB decides which of the
application layer measurement configurations should be kept or released,
e.g., based on application layer measurement configuration information
received from the source gNB in Xn/NG signalling.</p>
<p>When the UE resumes the connection with a gNB that does not support
QoE, the UE releases all application layer measurement
configurations.</p>
<h2 id="ran-visible-qoe-measurements">21.4 RAN Visible QoE
Measurements</h2>
<p>RAN visible QoE measurements are configured at the UE by the gNB,
where a subset of configured QoE metrics is reported from the UE to the
gNB as an explicit IE readable by the gNB. The RAN visible QoE
measurements can be used by the gNB for network optimization. The RAN
visible QoE measurements are supported for the DASH streaming and VR
services. The gNB configures the RAN visible QoE measurement of all or
some of the available RAN visible QoE metrics, where the indication of
metric availability is received by the gNB as part of management-based
or the signalling-based QoE configuration. The set of available RAN
visible QoE metrics is a subset of the metrics configured as part of QoE
measurement configuration encapsulated in the application layer
container. RAN visible QoE measurements and encapsulated QoE
measurements can be configured together or separately. RAN visible QoE
measurements can only be configured if there is a corresponding QoE
measurement configuration for the same service type configured at the
UE. The gNB may modify a RAN visible QoE configuration by releasing it
and configuring the UE with a new RAN visible QoE configuration
pertaining to the same QoE reference. In this case, the new RAN visible
QoE configuration applies immediately, i.e., during the same application
session.</p>
<p>Multiple simultaneous RAN visible QoE measurement configurations and
reports can be supported for RAN visible QoE measurements, and each RAN
visible QoE measurement configuration and report is identified by the
same measurement configuration application layer ID as the corresponding
QoE measurement configuration and measurement report. After receiving
the RAN visible QoE measurement configuration, the UE RRC layer forwards
the configuration to the application layer, indicating the service type,
the measurement configuration application layer ID and, optionally, the
reporting periodicity for RAN visible QoE. The application layer sends
the RAN visible QoE measurement report associated with the measurement
configuration application layer ID to the UE's AS layer. The PDU session
ID(s) corresponding to the service that is subject to QoE measurements
can also be reported by the UE along with the RAN visible QoE
measurement results.</p>
<p>If there is no reporting periodicity defined in the RAN visible QoE
configuration, the UE sends both RAN visible QoE measurement reports and
the QoE measurement reports to the gNB in the same
<em>MeasurementReportAppLayer</em> message, except when QoE measurement
collection pause indication is received (e.g., in case of RAN overload).
When a QoE measurement collection is paused, if there is no reporting
periodicity defined in the RAN visible QoE configuration, the
encapsulated QoE reports are stored at the UE's RRC layer, but the RAN
visible QoE reports continue to be reported to the gNB with the
reporting periodicity configured for encapsulated QoE reporting. The RAN
visible QoE measurements can be reported with a reporting periodicity
different from the one of the corresponding encapsulated QoE
measurements, when a dedicated RAN visible QoE reporting periodicity is
configured by the gNB. The UE Application layer can measure the RAN
visible QoE metrics based on this reporting periodicity.</p>
<p>The gNB can release one or multiple RAN visible QoE measurement
configurations from the UE in one <em>RRCReconfiguration</em> message at
any time. If the encapsulated QoE configuration is released, the
corresponding RAN visible QoE configuration shall be released as
well.</p>
<p>The RAN visible QoE configuration can be transferred from the source
gNB to the target gNB upon mobility and from the old gNB to the new gNB
during context retrieval. The target gNB or the new gNB can generate a
new RAN visible QoE configuration based on the available RAN visible QoE
metrics received and can send the new RAN visible QoE configuration to
the UE during handover or the RRC resume procedure.</p>
<h2 id="alignment-of-mdt-and-qoe-measurements">21.5 Alignment of MDT and
QoE Measurements</h2>
<p>The radio-related measurements may be collected via immediate MDT for
all types of supported services for the purpose of QoE analysis. The
MCE/TCE performs the correlation of the immediate MDT measurement
results and the QoE measurement results collected at the same UE.</p>
<p>The following is supported:</p>
<p>- Alignment between a signalling-based QoE measurement and a
signalling-based MDT measurement. In this case, the signalling-based QoE
configuration sent to the gNB includes the NG-RAN Trace ID of the
signalling-based MDT measurement.</p>
<p>- Alignment between a management-based QoE measurement and a
management-based MDT measurement.</p>
<p>The UE configured with QoE measurements sends an indication to inform
the gNB about the start or the stop of a QoE measurement session of
configured QoE measurements. The gNB can activate the MDT measurements
that are to be aligned with the QoE measurements performed by the UE
upon/after receiving the QoE measurement session start indication from
the UE. The gNB may activate the MDT measurements upon/after receiving
the MDT activation message from the OAM. The gNB can deactivate the
aligned MDT measurements according to an OAM command which may, e.g., be
triggered by the session stop indication.</p>
<p>The gNB includes time stamp information to the QoE measurement
reports to enable the correlation of corresponding measurement results
of MDT and QoE at the MCE/TCE. In addition, the gNB includes the MDT
session identifiers (Trace Reference and Trace Recording Session
Reference) in the corresponding QoE measurement report.</p>

<p>To improve UL coverage for high frequency scenarios, SUL can be
configured (see TS 38.101-1 [18]). With SUL, the UE is configured with 2
ULs for one DL of the same cell as depicted on Figure B.1-1 below:</p>

<p>For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the BWPs configured by a serving cell may
overlap in the frequency domain with the BWPs configured for other UEs
by other cells within a carrier. Multiple SSBs may also be transmitted
within the frequency span of a carrier used by the serving cell.
However, from the UE perspective, each serving cell is associated to at
most a single SSB. Figure B.2-1 below describes a scenario with multiple
SSBs in a carrier, identifying two different cells (NCGI = 5, associated
to SSB1, and NCGI = 6, associated to SSB3) with overlapping BWPs, and
where RRM measurements can be configured to be performed by the UE on
each of the available SSBs, i.e. SSB1, SSB2, SSB3 and SSB4.</p>

<p>The gNB depicted in Figure B.4-1 may be subdivided into non-NTN
infrastructure gNB functions and the NTN Service Link provisioning
system. The NTN infrastructure may be thought of being subdivided into
the NTN Service Link provisioning system and the NTN Control function.
The NTN Service Link provisioning system may consist of one or more NTN
payloads and NTN Gateways.</p>
<p>The NTN payload is embarked on a spaceborne (or airborne) vehicle,
providing a structure, power, commanding, telemetry, attitude control
for the satellite (resp. HAPS) and possibly an appropriate thermal
environment, radiation shielding.</p>
<p>The NTN Service Link provisioning system maps the NR-Uu radio
protocol over radio resources of the NTN infrastructure (e.g. beams,
channels, Tx power).</p>
<p>The NTN control function controls the spaceborne (or airborne)
vehicles as well as the radio resources of the NTN infrastructure (NTN
payload(s) &amp; NTN Gateway(s)). It provides control data, e.g.
Ephemeris, to the non-NTN infrastructure gNB functions of the gNB.</p>
<p>Provision of NTN control data to the gNB is out of 3GPP scope.</p>
<p>NOTE: The transport of NR-Uu protocol between the NTN Service Link
provisioning system and the non-NTN infrastructure gNB functions is out
of 3GPP scope.</p>

provided by O&amp;M to the gNB for its operation:</p>
<p>a) Earth-fixed beams: for each beam provided by a given
NTN-payload:</p>
<p>- The Cell identifier (NG and Uu) mapped to the beam;</p>
<p>- The Cell's reference location (e.g. cell's center and range).</p>
<p>b) Quasi-Earth-fixed: for each beam provided by a given NTN

NG-RAN node that allocated the UE context, the I-RNTI structure is as
follows:</p>
<p>- the first part (starting from the MSB of the I-RNTI) identifies the
I-RNTI profile. It is 2 bits long for a Full I-RNTI or 1 bit long for a
short I-RNTI, and it indicates the length of a Local NG-RAN Node
Identifier of the NG-RAN Node that allocated the I-RNTI;</p>
<p>- the second part, immediately following the first part, is a Local
NG-RAN Node Identifier;</p>
<p>- the third part, immediately following the second part, identifies
the UE context stored in the NG-RAN node that allocated the I-RNTI.</p>
<p>In case a NG-RAN node takes an additional Local NG-RAN Node
identifier into use or removes a Local NG-RAN Node identifier currently
in use it informs its neighbor NG-RAN nodes about this change.</p>
<p>The I-RNTI profiles for Full I-RNTI are described in table F-1.</p>
