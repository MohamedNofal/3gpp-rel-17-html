<h1 id="txd-basic-requirements">4 TxD Basic Requirements</h1>
<p>Editor’s note: This clause intends to summarize the key part of
technical agreements and related background of basic requirements for
TxD.</p>
<h2 id="antenna-number-and-declaration">4.1 Antenna number and
declaration</h2>
<h3 id="agreements">4.1.1 Agreements</h3>
<p>Only two antenna connectors were considered for TxD feature.</p>
<p>UE declares which connectors will be active per band under test. TE
needs to detect ACK and NACK and any other expected response from UE
from all declared TX antenna connectors.</p>
<p>- The word “active” can be replaced by “used for TxD during one test
procedure”. (Not necessarily to have transmission all the time.)</p>
<p>- UE declaration needs to describe exact two antenna connectors under
test.</p>
<h3 id="study-process">4.1.2 Study process</h3>
<p>Only two antenna connectors were considered for TxD feature and this
has been used in multiple cases and appeared in multiple WFs.</p>
<p>The earliest case can reference to agreed WF R4-2005652 for eMIMO in
RAN4#94-e-bis, in which the following agreements were made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <em>If transparent TxD is used in Scenario-1:</em></p>
<p>- <em>Transmission come out from two antenna connectors;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RAN4#97-e meeting, in [R4-2016959] and a WF [R4-2016830] was also
agreed. The agreements reached are as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <em>Declaration for Default TX Connector</em></p>
<p>- <em>UE declares which connectors will be active per band under
test. TE needs to detect ACK and NACK and any other expected response
from UE from all declared TX antenna connectors.</em></p>
<p>- <em>The word “active” can be replaced by “used for TxD during one
test procedure”. (Not necessarily to have transmission all the
time.)</em></p>
<p>- <em>UE declaration needs to describe exact two antenna connectors
under test.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In agreed MPR evaluation assumptions R4-2105331, two antennas are
also confirmed in :</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <em>RF assumptions:</em></p>
<p>- <em>4dB post PA losses</em></p>
<p>- <em>10dB antenna isolation</em></p>
<p>- <em>Equal power and Equal back-off power split for the two
antennas</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="summation-for-power-and-emission">4.2 Summation for Power and
Emission</h2>
<h3 id="agreements-1">4.2.1 Agreements</h3>
<p>RAN4 agree to define requirements for MOP and emission so that power
is measured correctly for all implementations, including UE with
transparent TxD:</p>
<p>- Use “requirements are defined as the sum of powers from both
connectors”.</p>
<p>- This shall be interpreted as: Measure the power and emissions per
connector and then sum them up afterwards.</p>
<p>- RAN4 will clean-up all requirements related to summing the powers
and emissions, including UL MIMO, UL full power transmission
requirement.</p>
<h3 id="study-process-1">4.2.2 Study process</h3>
<p>This issue has been discussed for how to write emission requirements
for several meetings, and gradually an agreement has been made in the
agreed WF R4-2011768 in RAN4#96-e in which the following agreements were
made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Summing the Powers and Emissions</em></p>
<p>- <em>RAN4 agree to define requirements for MOP and emission so that
power is measured correctly for all implementations, including UE with
transparent TxD:</em></p>
<p>- <em>Use “requirements are defined as the sum of powers from both
connectors”.</em></p>
<p>- <em>This shall be interpreted as: Measure the power and emissions
per connector and then sum them up afterwards.</em></p>
<p>- <em>RAN4 will clean-up all requirements related to summing the

<h3 id="error-vector-magnitude">4.3.1 Error Vector Magnitude</h3>
<h4 id="agreements-2">4.3.1.1 Agreements</h4>
<p>For TxD, the latest agreements are as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Proposals:</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: As in agreed WF R4-2008465</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[EVM = \sqrt{(P_{1}*{EVM}_{1}^{2} + \

<p><em>Agreements(GTW):</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2</em></p>
<p>- <em>For UL MIMO, Option 3 or options along those lines can be

</blockquote>
<h4 id="study-process-2">4.3.1.2 Study process</h4>
<p>Originally there was a different agreement from the final one. In
agreed WF R4-2008465 in RAN4#95-e as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Issue 3-3-4: EVM for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p>- <em>Agree EVM defined as</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[EVM = \sqrt{(P_{1}*{EVM}_{1}^{2} + \

</blockquote>
<p>In RAN4#96-e, new scheme was proposed in R4-2011519, and the EVM
discussion was re-started, there is one agreed WF R4-2011768 in which
the following agreements were made</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>EVM Requirement for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p>- <em>Background:</em></p>
<p>- <em>In RAN4#95e, RAN4 agree to define EVM for transparent TxD
as:</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[EVM = \sqrt{(P_{1}*{EVM}_{1}^{2} + \
P_{2}*{EVM}_{2}^{2})/(P1\  + \ P2)}\]</span></p>
<p>- <em>RAN4 further study new test method and EVM definition proposed
in R4-2011519:</em></p>
<p>- <em>FFS whether or not to use new EVM definition to replace above
definition.</em></p>
<p>- <em>RAN4 agree the location in Specification to capture EVM
definition for transparent TxD, as</em></p>
<p>- <em>Annex F</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After continuous discussion, in RAN4#98-e-bis, in the WF R4-2105330
is for general TxD and power class issue following agreements were
made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <em>CR related – EVM</em></p>
<p>- <em>Proposals:</em></p>

<h3 id="spectrum-flatness">4.3.2 Spectrum flatness</h3>
<h4 id="agreements-3">4.3.2.1 Agreements</h4>
<p>The agreements were as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agreements</em></p>

<h4 id="study-process-3">4.3.2.2 Study process</h4>
<p>This issue has been raised in RAN4#99-e in R4-2108793, and agreements
were documented in the agreed WF R4-210774.</p>
<h2 id="maximum-output-power-reduction">4.4 Maximum output power
reduction</h2>
<h3 id="general">4.4.1 General</h3>
<h4 id="agreements-4">4.4.1.1 Agreements</h4>
<p>Here are some early stage agreements before a comprehensive
evaluation.</p>
<p>It has been agreed that MPRs for UL-MIMO would need to be
re-visited.</p>
<p>For MPR Requirement for Transparent TxD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>RAN4 agree MPR defined for TxD is applied to the total output
power rather than at each antenna connector</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For TxD and UL-MIMO, it has been agreed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>2 Tx MPR should be the same MPR requirement for TX Diversity and
UL MIMO for the same power class.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For eMIMO and ULFPTx related, The agreement reached is as
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Chair: It is agreed that one set of MPR requirements should be
adopted for both UL MIMO (including ULFPTx) and TxD”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>WF R4-2105331 is agreed MPR evaluation assumptions, and it is agreed
that an evaluation is necessary to further progress the MPR work.</p>
<p>The key agreements and the related evaluation are incorporated in
clause 4.4.2, 4.4.3 etc.</p>
<h4 id="study-process-4">4.4.1.2 Study process</h4>
<p>Here are some early stage studies before a comprehensive
evaluation.</p>
<p>In RAN4#94-e-bis, in the WF R4-2005216, it has been agreed</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- R15 UL MIMO emission requirements shall apply to UE level.</p>
<p>- Relating MPRs are need to be re-visited.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RAN4#95-e, a WF R4-2008465 was agreed in which:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Issue 3-3-2: Unwanted emissions for Transparent TxD: MPR
study</em></p>
<p><em>Possible WF:</em></p>
<p><em>Simulation/measurement assumptions for MPR study for 2Tx
UE’s</em></p>
<p><em>Follow 29 dBm WI assumptions in R4-2005190</em></p>
<p><em>Two 20dBm Tx chains are not precluded</em></p>
<p><em>Two 23dBm Tx chains are not precluded</em></p>
<p><em>Two 26dBm Tx chains are precluded</em></p>
<p><em>MPRs are defined for each power class separately</em></p>
<p><em>PC3 = 2x20dBm</em></p>
<p><em>PC2 = 2x23dBm</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RAN4#96-e, the agreed WF R4-2011768 has the following
contents:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>MPR Requirement for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 agree MPR defined for TxD is applied to the total output
power rather than at each antenna connector</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the meantime, for eMIMO WI, the MPR was an remaining issue:</p>
<p><em>“The Chairmain commented that for PC2 and PC3, MPR issues related
to 2TX, including UL-MIMO, uplink full power transmission, and TxD, will

<p>In RAN4#97-e meeting, the transparent TxD was discussed under TEI16
as documented in [R4-2016959] and a WF [R4-2016830] was also agreed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>MPR for Transparent and UL MIMO</em></p>
<p><em>Whether 2 Tx MPR should be the same MPR requirement for TX
Diversity and UL MIMO for the same power class.</em></p>
<p><em>Agreement</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Option 1: Yes</p>
<p>For eMIMO and ULFPTx related, there is very few maintenance remains
and only MPR was discussed. The agreement reached is as following:</p>
<p><em>“Chair: It is agreed that one set of MPR requirements should be
adopted for both UL MIMO (including ULFPTx) and TxD”</em></p>
<p>In RAN4#98-e-bis, the MPR was extensively discussed, but no
agreements can be reached, but an evaluation is agreed to be
started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>CR related - MPR</em></p>
<p><em>Proposals:</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: As in last meeting’s Endorsed CR R4-2107307</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Base on the proposals in R4-2104538</em></p>
<p><em>1.5dB offset for Edge and outer, 0.5dB offset for inner compared

<p><em>Option 3: Reconsider separating MPR requirements for UL-MIMO and
TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Also consider A-MPR impact in next issue and as in

<p><em>Agreements (GTW) :</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 to start a evaluation campaign to derive the MPR values for
both UL-MIMO and TxD, with agreed evaluation assumptions and UE
implementations. Decisions will be made in the May meeting</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another WF R4-2105331 is MPR evaluation assumptions, it is agreed
that an evaluation is necessary to further progress the MPR work, and a
detailed assumptions were agreed. The contents were not listed.</p>
<p>Later studies are not listed here in a meeting by meeting manner. The
key evaluation and agreements are incorporated in clause 4.4.2, 4.4.3
etc.</p>
<h3 id="mpr-evaluation-for-txd">4.4.2 MPR evaluation for TxD</h3>
<h4 id="architecture-and-reverse-imd-impact">4.4.2.1 Architecture and
reverse IMD impact</h4>
<p>Transparent transmit diversity was defined in Release 15 but no
specific MPR has been evaluated at the time and especially PC2 for band
n77/78 and 79 was agreed to be based on 2Tx with two 23dBm capable
PAs.</p>
<p>In Release 16, UL MIMO feature was also defined for PC3 and assumed
that two 23dBm PAs were available thus the 1Tx PC3 MPR could be reused.
In Release 16 also, PC1.5 power class was defined based on a 2Tx
architecture using two PC2 PAs and related MPR was evaluated including
reverse IMD impact and specified.</p>
<p>In Release 17, it was agreed that proper evaluation of 2Tx PC2 MPR
for TxD was needed as 1TX PC2 MPR could not apply as is due to
additional non-linearity related to Reverse IMD but also from a slightly
different linearity operating point.</p>
<p>Because of the reverse IMD aspects, similation based on AM/PM
modelling of PAs is not properly describing the effect of the PAs
cross-coupling and this specific two PAs measurements must be conducted
with careful attention on waveform applied at each PA inputs to avoid
cancellation/re-construction mechanisms.</p>
<p>As it was agreed that TxD and UL MIMO should use the same MPR
requirement for the same power class and architecture, to have 2Tx MPR
requirement that is valid for both TxD and UL MIMO in different modes,
the evaluation is based on using waveform representative of:</p>
<p>TxD operation with SD-CDD (Small Delay-Cyclic Deleay Diversity) with
properly chosen delay between each transmit path</p>
<p>Single stream UL MIMO operation with properly chosen quadrature phase
offset between each transmit path</p>
<p>Two stream UL MIMO operation with uncorrelated signals in each
transmit paths.</p>
<p>Similarly, proper PA linearity calibration is needed for the
different cases:</p>
<p>PC3 (23dBm) capable PA lienarity operating point is based on reaching
22dBm with 30dB ACLR for 20MHz DFT-s-OFDM QPSK 100RB0 waveform</p>
<p>PC2 (26dBm) capable PA lienarity operating point is based on reaching
25dBm with 31dB ACLR for 20MHz DFT-s-OFDM QPSK 100RB0 waveform</p>
<p>Since emissions requirements are valid at the UE level and the tests
are performed on antenna connectors it was agreed that 2Tx UE emissions
are evaluated by using the power sum of emissions at each antenna
connector. It was also agreed that EVM will be measured on each
connector and a compound EVM will be derived.</p>
<p>In the following chapter, we will discuss the different architectures
that have been used as baseline assumption for the 2Tx MPR evaluation
and over architectural assumptions.</p>
<h4 id="baseline-architecture-for-different-power-classes">4.4.2.2
Baseline architecture for different power classes</h4>
<h5 id="tx-pc3-with-txd">4.4.2.2.1 2Tx PC3 with TxD</h5>
<p>For 2Tx PC3 with TxD, consistent with Release 16, the baseline
architecture is based on two PC3 (23dBm) capable PAs and as such the 1Tx
PC3 MPR is applicable since each PA can meet the 1Tx MPR. Furthermore,
full UL transmit power is feasible since both antennas support a PC3
capable PA.</p>
<p>It should be noted that 1Tx PC3 A-MPR can also be reused with the
same justification.</p>
<p>Other architectures may be implemented for 2TX PC3, for example:</p>
<p>Two 20dBm PAs</p>
<p>One 23dBm PA with one 20dBm PA.</p>
<p>Although not precluded, these other implementations must comply with
the PC3 1Tx in both 2Tx and full UL transmit operation.</p>
<h5 id="tx-pc2-with-txd">4.4.2.2.2 2Tx PC2 with TxD</h5>
<p>For 2Tx PC2 with TxD, the baseline architecture is based on two PC3
(26dBm) capable PAs, but it can’t reuse the 1TX PC2 MPR since there is
additional reverse IMD contribution to emissions and at the linearity
calibration point, each PC3 PA is 1dB short in meeting the PC2 31dB
ACLR.</p>
<p>In order to allow consistent evaluation of PC2 2Tx MPR across
companies, the following assumptions were used:</p>
<p>PA calibration: each PC3 PAs are calibrated for 30dB ACLR 1dB MPR for
20MHz QPSK DFT-s-OFDM 100RB0 waveform</p>
<p>Post PA losses of 4dB</p>
<p>Antenna Isolation of 10dB.</p>
<p>Although not precluded, other implementations must comply with the
PC2 2Tx MPR defined for the baseline architecture, and benefit from
better linearity. As such, they could benefit from better MPR
requirement, but this optimization is postponed to later work in RAN4,
for example architectures including one or two PC2 capable PAs:</p>
<p>Two 26dBm PAs, in this case it was shown that a specific 2Tx MPR
could be derived from the PC1.5 MPR as it is the same architecture and
ACLR target thus MPR values are just reduced by 3dB (negative values
after the 3dB reductions are clamped to 0dB) since the reference power
is reduced to 26dBm instead of 29dBm. UL full power can be delivered on
both antennas without needed any swapping.</p>
<p>One 26dBm PA with one 23dBm PA, in this case it was shown that 1Tx
PC2 MPR since one of the PA is already capable of the PC2 MPR but
benefits from an intrinsic 3dB backoff that is more than enough to
compensate for the smaller PA reduced linearity and the additional
reverse IMD contribution. Furthermore, UL full power is feasible without
TxD.</p>
<h5 id="comparison-to-smartphone-and-fwa-2tx-pc1.5-case">4.4.2.2.3
Comparison to smartphone and FWA 2Tx PC1.5 case</h5>
<p>Even if this report is focussed on PC2 TxD, it is of interest to
compare this work with similar work conducted in Release 17 for PC1.5
MPR optimization. Since PC1.5 is also based on 2Tx architecture using
two PC2 (26dBm) capable PAs it suffers from the same reverse IMD impact
but not from the reduced ACLR linearity since both PC2 and PC1.5 need to
meet 31dB ACLR.</p>
<p>In this MPR optimization work, for smartphone the same type of
architecture assumptions has been used than for the PC2 TxD work:</p>
<p>PA calibration: each PC2 PAs are calibrated for 31dB ACLR 1dB MPR for
20MHz QPSK DFT-s-OFDM 100RB0 waveform</p>
<p>Post PA losses of 4dB</p>
<p>Antenna Isolation of 10dB</p>
<p>Use of SD-CDD, phase shifted and uncorrelated waveforms</p>
<p>On top of this another set of assumptions were used to reflect better
antenna design of FWA devices and especially improved antenna isolation
which, in turn, would reduce the impact of reverse IMD. It was found
however that beyond some antenna isolation level, the PA outputs can
couple to the other PA inputs via limited PCB isolation. Given that
further limitation, it was decided that imoroved PCB isolation is also
assmed for FWA but that antenna isolation is still limited to 20dB
resulting in following MPR evaluation assumptions:</p>
<p>PA calibration: each PC2 PAs are calibrated for 31dB ACLR 1dB MPR for
20MHz QPSK DFT-s-OFDM 100RB0 waveform</p>
<p>Post PA losses of 4dB</p>
<p>Antenna Isolation of 20dB</p>
<p>Use of SD-CDD, phase shifted and uncorrelated waveforms.</p>
<h5 id="other-2tx-mpr-evaluations-in-release-17">4.4.2.2.4 Other 2Tx MPR
evaluations in Release 17</h5>
<p>It should be noted that several 2CC with 2Tx cases were evaluated in
Release 17 on top this PC2 TxD effort:</p>
<p>PC2 contiguous UL CA with two PC2 PAs and 2LO (1PA per CC)</p>
<p>PC2 contiguous UL CA with two PC3 PAs and 1LO using TxD</p>
<p>PC2 contiguous UL CA with UL MIMO two PC3 PAs and 1LO</p>
<p>PC2 non-contiguous UL CA with two PC3 PAs and 1LO using TxD</p>
<p>PC2 non-contiguous UL CA with two PC2 PAs and 2LO (1PA per CC)</p>
<p>PC2 non-contiguous UL CA with one PC2 PA and one PC3 PA and 2LO (1PA
per CC)</p>
<p>In all these cases the same 10dB antenna isolation and 4dB post PA
losses where use with the associated PC2/PC3 PA calibrations and
specific 2Tx waveforms.</p>
<h4 id="pc2-2tx-mpr-measurements-results-and-specification">4.4.2.3 PC2
2Tx MPR measurements results and specification</h4>
<h5 id="initial-evaluation-results">4.4.2.3.1 Initial evaluation
results</h5>
<p>Results provided in RAN4#100e for the basis of the MPR table proposal
were based on measurements of two coupled PAs with the following
assumptions:</p>
<p>PA calibration: each PC3 PAs are calibrated for 30dB ACLR 1dB MPR for
20MHz QPSK DFT-s-OFDM 100RB0 waveform</p>
<p>Post PA losses of 4dB</p>
<p>Antenna Isolation of 10dB.</p>
<p>Measurements included a selected set of waveforms with separate
waveforms for each path representative of the the 3 2Tx operations and
carefully selected to avoid cancelling/re-constructing behavior when
coupling the PAs:</p>
<p>QPSK CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM waveforms for 5/20/50MHz with 15kHz
SCS</p>
<p>600ns delay SD-CDD waveforms for TxD evaluation</p>
<p>90deg phase shifted waveform for 1layer UL MIMO</p>
<p>Uncorrelated waveforms for 2 layer UL MIMO.</p>
<p>In order to provide a direct reading of the reverse IMD and PA
linearity impact, the two PC3 PA measurements were compared to the
measurement of one of the PA but biased for PC2 operaton,</p>
<p>When compared to 1Tx PC2 PA measurements in the same conditions, the
following additional back-off were identified:</p>
<p>Edge allocations can reuse 1Tx PC2 MPR as they are limited by the
spectrum shape in relation to BB filtering (WOLA) and are not dominated
by PA non-linearity</p>
<p>Outer allocations need 1dB additional back-off compared to
corresponding 1Tx PC2 MPR</p>
<p>Inner allocation need 1dB additional back-off compared to
corresponding 1Tx PC2 MPR.</p>
<p>Some discussion was also provided on the impact of RIMD to meet
emissions for higher order modulations:</p>
<p>with higher back-off already available, the additional back-off can
be reduced until limitation comes from tight EVM budget. For that same
reason, CP-OFDM already having higher MPR can have slightly lower
additional MPR, then everything is within the 0.5dB granularity.</p>
<p>Beyond this additional MPR needed to meet emissions, additional
back-off is also needed for high order modulations cases to compensate
for the additional contribution of RIMD and 1dB lower ACLR linearity.
Earlier contributions [4] estimated that 256 QAM DFT-s waveforms need 1
dB more MPR and CP-OFDM 2 dB more MPR for Tx diversity UEs. To be
consistent, we also suggest that 0.5dB be added for DFT 64QAM and 1dB
for CP.</p>
<p>Based on this input, the following way forwards were agreed in
RAN4#100e</p>
<p>Way Forward for 2Tx PC3 operation:</p>
<p>UE declaring PC3 and TxD or UL MIMO with or without
<em><strong>ULFPTx</strong></em> support shall meet 1Tx PC3 MPR
table</p>
<p>2TX TxD or UL MIMO PC3 single CC operation specification can use the
same 1Tx MPR as in Table 6.2.2-1 in 38.1010-1.</p>

<p>Way forward for MPR for 2Tx PC2 ULFPTx MIMO based on at least one PC2

<p>Further study if PC2 + PC3 architecture can reuse 1Tx PC2 MPR</p>
<p>Architecture using two PC2 PA can reuse 1Tx PC2 MPR similarly to the

<p>It is further studied if an improved MPR can be based on the PC1.5MPR

<p>Rel-17 Signaling to differentiate sets of PC2 MPR requirements for
different PA configurations can be further studied in phase 2.</p>
<p>Additional input was provided in the next meeting by another company
which allowed further refinement on higher order modulations and some
critical allocations.</p>
<p>It was also decided that a single set of PC2 2Tx requirements will be
used in Release 17 but that 1 antenna port transmission should take the
architecture in to account (presence of a full power PA or not).</p>
<p>Since it was agreed that both UL MIMO and TxD would use the same 2Tx
MPR table for the same power class and UE architecture, it was decided
that all the 2Tx MPR tables would be placed in the UL MIMO section D and
the TxD section G would point to the relevant tables.</p>

<p>In RAN4#100-e, no agreements were reached on this issue.</p>
<p>In RAN4#101-e, this issue was moved to Rel-15 maintenance agenda, and
a Rel-15 CR R4-2118286 reflecting previous agreement was agreed as
following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If UE is scheduled for single antenna-port PUSCH transmission by
DCI format 0_0 or by DCI format 0_1 for single antenna port codebook
based transmission, the requirements in clause 6.2.1 apply <u>for the
power class as indicated by the ue-PowerClass field in capability
signalling</u>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This clarification is identical to Rel-16. This means that the 1-port
fall back of SA UE power class for UL-MIMO is aligned to the power class
as indicated by the ue-PowerClass field in capability signalling.</p>
<p>In RAN4#101-e-bis, during the discussion of the draft TP, it was
pointed out that although some companies' understanding of the intention
is SA UE declaring PC2 HPUE shall have 26dBm MOP either by full power
chain 1Tx or using TxD, the current requirements for applicability is
referenced to clause 6.2.1, which is specific for 1Tx, thus make TxD
support difficult. The TP drafting was delayed for SA part.</p>
<p>In RAN4#102, it is proposed to let the spec stay as it is as this is
already a stable agreement, and no more correction/update seems possible
or needed.</p>
<h3 id="en-dc">5.1.2 EN-DC</h3>
<h4 id="agreements-8">5.1.2.1 Agreements</h4>
<p>Depending on UE architecture, NR part of EN-DC may have different
power class compared to SA NR for the same UE which can support both SA
and EN-DC.</p>
<p>For Rel-16, dedicated signalling was introduced for NR part power
class in EN-DC, and the NR in EN-DC was to follow this power class. It
was specified in 38.101-3 as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“If UE indicates IE powerClassNRPart-r16 as defined in TS 38.331
[9] in EN-DC, UE shall meet NR requirements according to this power
class.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Rel-15, no dedicated signalling was introduced for NR part power
class in EN-DC. It was specified in 38.101-3 as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>” <u>Unless otherwise stated, if UE indicates IE
maxNumberSRS-Ports-PerResource = n2 in NR standalone operation mode, the
said UE shall meet the NR requirements for either power class 2 or power
class 3 in EN-DC within FR1 if UE indicates IE
maxNumberSRS-Ports-PerResource = n1 for EN-DC on this NR
band.</u></em>”</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="study-process-8">5.1.2.2 Study process</h4>
<p><strong>For Rel-15:</strong></p>
<p>The power class ambiguity issue was raised since there could be
different understanding in SA and EN-DC case, and some ambiguity was
originated from the transparent nature of TxD. An early summary
R4-1913067 was agreed in RAN4#92bis, in which it was agreed that no new
signalling would be introduced for Rel-15.</p>
<p>In RAN4#93, Rel-15 CR R4-1916137 for clarification of ENDC power
class has been agreed, in which clarification was added for the scenario
that UE supports PC2 SA NR with 2x23 dBm PAs will report PC2 for NR even
though it only support PC3 for NR in EN-DC if UE do not declare support
of 2-layer for EN-DC on this NR band:</p>
<p><em>” <u>Unless otherwise stated, if UE indicates IE
maxNumberSRS-Ports-PerResource = n2 in NR standalone operation mode, the
said UE shall meet the NR requirements for either power class 2 or power
class 3 in EN-DC within FR1 if UE indicates IE
maxNumberSRS-Ports-PerResource = n1 for EN-DC on this NR
band.</u></em>”</p>
<p>This has become a “famuous sentence” in RAN4 for a long time, and is
kept as it is. The discussion can be divided into following phases:</p>
<p>Phase 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “famous sentence”, come from the intention that UE do not equip a
full-power PA may declare PC2 for SA NR by means of TxD. Vendors want to
keep the possibility of non-full power PA implementation for PC2 in
Rel-15 (This point itself may also controversial). However, since there
is no separate capability for NR within ENDC for Rel-15, without further
clarification, one can only assume same power class between NR SA and NR
within EN-DC. Then it comes the “famous sentence”, to provide UE this
flexibility. However, the descriptions were very indirect and involves
many parameters, since there is no sign/capability of architecture.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phase 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a while, and the “famous sentence” was stable. Some company
raise the proposal to revise Pcmax related parameters to achieve more
precise PHR reporting, to better adapt the general part “famous
sentence”. Later other company has slightly different ones that always
assumes a “relaxation” for lower power class.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phase 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In RAN4#99, with newly introduced TxD capability used by Rel-15,
there is a possible new way to signal architecture by vivo, that is: A
UE without TxD capability has to have a full power PA for Rel-15. This
was also means TxD capability UE may not have full-power PA. This is the
first time that this no-full power PA architecture can be implicitly
signaled. To utilize this, a draft CR R4-2113013 was endorsed, and the
applicability of this “famous sentence” can be reduced, while keeping
the implementation flexibility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Phase 4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In RAN4#100e, Different CRs were raised to adapt endorsed CR
R4-2113013 was raised. However, no conclusion can be made, and the
original endorsed CR in RAN#99e was obsolete since opposed by
companies.</p>
<p>In RAN4#101e, this issue was moved to TEI15 agenda, and it was agreed
in R4-2119835 that everything to be kept as it is and no more revision
is pursued on this issue in Rel-15.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A more detailed history background can reference to a summary
document in R4-2118285.</p>
<p><strong>For Rel-16:</strong></p>
<p>The power class ambiguity issue for Rel-16 was deviated from Rel-15.
The problem for Rel-16 was raised in RAN#88-e in RP-201032. The solution
of introducing specific RAN2 signalling was agreed and an LS RP-201392
was approved.</p>
<p>The power class for NR band in MR-DC could be different from that
indicated in SA mode. If the power class of NR part is reported for the
MR-DC, the UE shall meet the NR requirements for power class indicated
by the newly introduced IE. The NR power class in Pcmax should then use
the one indicated by the new IE instead.The Rel-16 EN-DC power class
ambiguity problem related to TxD was solved.</p>
<p>For power class related issues, a LS was sent back to GCF in
R4-2011903 to clarify the Rel-16 status for the power class issues,
while the Rel-15 remains to be discussed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“”RAN4 thanks GCF CAG for the LS on power class ambiguities in
RAN4 specification and would like to inform GCF CAG about the latest
progress.</em></p>
<p><em>1. It is agreed that new power class capability signalling for NR
in EN-DC is introduced in Rel-16 to distinguish power class capability
of NR in EN-DC from power class capability of NR in SA.</em></p>
<p><em>2. It is agreed that Rel-16 UE shall meet same power class
requirements between single antenna port mode and UL MIMO in
SA.</em></p>
<p><em>3. It is agreed that transparent Tx diversity (TxD) is enabled at
least from Rel-16 RAN4 specification.</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 will inform GCF about the progress of Rel-15 power class
clarification, once consensus is reached.”</em></p>

<p>The requirement that Mode 0 UEs or UEs supporting Mode 2 Mechanism 2
meet the power class with a single connector (single TX) is driven by
the need for consistent virtualization among DCI 0_0 and 0_1 and among
single and two port SRS transmission.</p>
<p>One potential implementation that could be considered is to
virtualize two antenna port transmission by transmitting one port as the
sum of the TX chains, and the other as the difference of the two chains.
Since in this implementation, the UE virtualizes to form an SRS port,
two SRS ports must be transmitted in the same symbol on a TX chain,
which could degrade the PAPR of SRS transmission. The UE would need to
transmit two SRS ports on each PA in a symbol as described in [2].
Furthermore, the UE must use the same virtualization for PUSCH. With
such a virtualization for PUSCH, each Tx chain will carry two layers in
the case of rank 2 transmission. Therefore, the PAPR of PUSCH could be
degraded, which is contrary to the desire to support UL full power
transmission in the UE.</p>
<p>Another aspect to consider is consistent single port operation in DCI
0_0 and 0_1. If a UE is configured with one port, it must transmit PUSCH
in the same way it transmits SRS. Since DCI 0_0 is single port
transmission, then transmitting with DCI 0_0 and 0_1 should result in
the same PUSCH. Therefore, DCI 0_0 and 0_1 should use the same number of
connectors and requirements for single port transmission.</p>
<p>Hence a UE configured for Mode 2 Mechanism 2 shall the meet the power
class requirement one connector (i.e. without virtualization). A similar
argument holds for Mode 0.</p>
<h4 id="srs-antenna-switching-and-ulfptx">5.3.1.2 SRS antenna switching
and ULFPTx</h4>
<p>The requirements on the configured maximum output power
P<sub>CMAX,f,c</sub> (sub-clause 6.2.4 of 38.101-1) during SRS
transmission occasions do not depend on the full-power mode configured
but on indication of <em>txDiversity-r16</em>, the number of SRS ports
and the power class supported. Given this, for ULFPTx modes in Table
5.3.1-1 supported by UE implemenations also indicating
<em>txDiversity-r16</em> using ‘dual TX’ for achieving full-power, the
requirements prevent antenna virtualization during single-port SRS
transmissions for DL CSI estimation.</p>

<p>Editor’s note: The discussion process and analysis have not been
completed yet.</p>
<p>In Rel-16, the feature of Uplink full power transmission (ULFPTx) is
introduced in the RAN1-led work item of “enhancements on MIMO for NR”.
During the Rel-16 RAN4 discussion on ULFPTx, there are some agreement
achieved related to transparent TxD.</p>
<p>In RAN4#95-e, there is agreed WF R4-2008462 in which the following
agreements in transparent TxD applicability related to ULFPTx was
made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Transparent TxD’s applicability for UEs supporting or not
supporting ULFPTx in Rel-16</strong></p>
<p>[Reconfirm previous agreement] “The applicability of Transparent TxD
is NOT related to UE supporting or not supporting Rel-16 ULFPTx”</p>
<p>[Newly added] In Rel-16, RAN4 <strong>ULFPTx</strong> requirement
needs to allow UE to use transparent TxD to achieve the required
transmission power in following cases:</p>

DCI_0_0 or single SRS port with DCI_0_1)</p>
<p>FFS transparent TxD can be used for UE configured with two SRS
ports</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RAN4#100-e, draft CR (R4-2115110), the MOP requirement for
fallback DCI in section 6.2D.1 is restricted to UE not indicating Tx
diversity (with or without ULFPTx configured). For UE indicating Tx
diversity (with or without ULFPTx), the MOP requirement in section
6.2G.1 shall be applied.</p>
<p>In RAN4#101-e, the detailed ULFPTx feature is reviewed, in which
different modes of ULFPTx have been analysed and captured in the clause
5.3.3.</p>
<p>In RAN4#102-e requirements for single-antenna fallback for UEs
configured with ULFPTx were agreed in R4-2206519. A summary of

RF Architecture Review for UE with Rel-16 ULFPTx Feature </h3>
<p>In Rel-16, RAN1 has introduced the feature of UL full power
transmission (ULFPTx) and RAN4 identified the corresponding impacts on
RAN4 requirement. It should be noted the clause 5.3.3 is provided to
introduce the ULFPTx feature which is intended to provide information
for the relevant Rel-17 TxD discussion, and specifically the three
ULFPTx modes are presented in the following sub-clauses.</p>
<h4
id="ulfptx-mode-1-ul-fullpowertransmission-r16-fullpowermode1">5.3.3.1
ULFPTx Mode 1 (<em>ul-FullPowerTransmission-r16 =
’fullpowerMode1’</em>): </h4>
<p>ULFPTx Mode 1 is proposed for the UEs with non-Coherent or partial
coherent UL-MIMO codebook, with codbookSubset = nonCoherent.
Particularly, new TPMI (originally for fullCoherent codebook in Rel-15)
is enabled for partial-/non-coherent codebook as full-power transmission
purpose for Rel-16 ULFPTx Mode 1 capable UE, while the same power
scaling mechanism as Rel-15 is used. Although it is not explicitly
required, ULPFTx Mode 1 is more reasonable to be applied for UE with
either (1) UEs with no full-rated PAs on any of TX chains, or (2) UEs
with full rated PAs on the subset of TX chains. Because RAN4 discussion
is only restricted to 2TX case, so here below is the case which
introduce RAN4 specification impact:</p>

ULFPTx Mode 2 (ul-FullPowerTransmission-r16 = ’fullpowerMode2’): </h4>
<p>Compared with Mode-1/0, ULFPTx Mode 2 is more complex, since two
mechanisms are specified, where one of them is configured by gNB.
Similar to Mode 1, although it is not explicitly required, ULPFTx Mode 2
is more reasonable to be applied for UE with either (1) UEs with no
full-rated PAs on any of TX chains, or (2) UEs with full rated PAs on
the subset of TX chains.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ULFPTx Mode 2 Mechanism-1 (SRS port virtualization):</p>
<p>In this Mechanism-1, UE is configured multiple SRS resources having
different number of ports, while the full power transmission is achieved
if SRI is indicated for the SRS with one port. In this mechanism-1, the
same power scaling as Rel-15 is applied.</p>

<p>ULFPTx Mode 2 Mechanism-2 (TPMI indication):</p>
<p>In this Mechanism-2, UE reports existing TPMI(s) available for full

behaviour of power scaling:</p>

ULFPTx Mode 0 (ul-FullPowerTransmission-r16 = ’fullpower’): </h4>
<p>ULFPTx Mode 0 is proposed for the UEs with full-rated PAs on each TX
chain. For UE supporting ULFPTx Mode 0, Rel-16 power scaling factor s =
1, which is compared with Rel-15 power scaling factor (i.e., s = ratio
of # non-zero PUSCH transmission power to # of SRS ports). For the below
case, Rel-16 ULFPTx Mode-0 can enable the full power transmission while
Rel-15 mechanism can only achieve half of power, i.e., s = ½ for TPMI =

<h2 id="capability-signalling">6.1 Capability signalling</h2>
<h3 id="agreements-11">6.1.1 Agreements</h3>
<p>For the signalling options for transparent TxD, as in the WF
R4-2103390 and outgoing LS R4-2103360, RAN4 has agreed to introduce a
new per-band capability signaling in Rel-16 for FR1 UEs supporting
transparent TxD. RAN4 would also like to ask RAN2 to enable
release-independent support of this new capability from Rel-15 for PC2,
if possible.</p>
<p>There is following reply from RAN2.</p>
<p>- RAN2 has discussed whether to enable release-independent support of
this new capability from Rel-15, and the following agreements have been
achieved:</p>
<p>- RAN2 can support release independent capability of transparent TxD
for Rel-15, by allowing early implementation of the Rel-16 CRs.</p>
<p>- It is possible to only apply the change for this new capability for
PC2 UEs for Rel-15, but RAN2 would like to understand whether the Rel-16
capability signalling applies for all PCs, while Rel-15 capability
signalling applies for just PC2 (as this difference in Rel-15 and Rel-16
capability might impact the signalling design)?</p>
<p>- RAN2 would also like to confirm whether this new capability has any
dependencies with other capabilities that should be captured by RAN2
(since the capability is intended as release independent, RAN2 may need
to capture such pre-requisites explicitly).”</p>
<p>After receiving the LS, it is agreed that capability singling for TxD
applies for all power classes for both Rel-15 and Rel-16 in the WF
R4-2107740.</p>
<p>The dependencies with other capabilities were still under
discussion.</p>
<p>In RAN4#100-e, it was formally approved by RAN4 in the LS out to RAN2
in R4-2115111 that:</p>
<p>- RAN4 would like to confirm the capability of transparent TxD
applies to all power classes equally in all the applicable releases via
a release independent manner.</p>
<p>This has clarified that the power classes would not be differentiated
for release independency.</p>
<p>In RAN4#108bis, during the discussion of 4Tx feature, it is agreed to
clarify that the legacy per-band TxDiversity capability introduced from
Rel-16 is for 2Tx only in the approved LS R4-2317617.</p>
<p>RAN4#109 clarified applicability of txDiversity2Tx-r18,
txDiversity4Tx-r18 or txDiversity-r16 in terms of single band (non-CA)
and CA, respectively in the approved LS R4-2321983. The essentials are
summarized below.</p>
<p>- txDiversity2Tx-r18 or txDiversity4Tx-r18 is applicable to both
single band (non-CA) case and CA case</p>
<p>- Support of txDiversity4Tx-r18 doesn’t require that of
txDiversity2Tx-r18</p>
<p>- No inheritance of support of any three txDiversity capabilities
from single band to band combination, i.e.,</p>
<p>- Support of txDiversity-r16 for a single band, or that of
txDiversity4Tx-r18 or txDiversity2Tx-r18 for a single band
band-combination means the support is applicable to the single band only
and not inherited to the band in any band combinations including the
band.</p>
<p>Whether to support TxD for the band in a band combination is
determined by txDiversity2Tx-r18 and/or txDiversity4Tx-r18, but not by
txDiversity-r16.</p>
<h3 id="study-process-11">6.1.2 Study process</h3>
<p>In RAN4#96-e, the signaling for Transparent TxD was started to be
discussed, and continued for several meetings without progress.</p>
<p>in RAN4#98-e, there is major break through in this topic with the TxD
capability signlaing and release independency. In the agreed WF
R4-2103390, the following agreements were made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Signaling for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Whether and how RAN4 introduce signalling for transparent
TxD:</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Introduce some sort of signaling by UE</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1a. Use ModifiedMPRbehavior bits to signal additional
relaxations;</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1b: Introducing a new ( per band capability) signalling
for TxD together with existing power classes</em></p>
<p><em>Capability reporting for supporting TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1c: Introducing a new power class (e.g. PC2.5) for
TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Based on UE vendor declaration.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 3: Using existing signalling to indicate the 2Tx
implementation capability.</em></p>
<p><em>Recommended WF</em></p>
<p><em>For R15 UEs, UE vendor declaration can be used in
testing</em></p>
<p><em>For R16 UEs, new signaling, i.e. 1b, is needed to inform the
network of the support of TxD. If the signaling can be made to enable
release-independent support of TxD from R15 can be consulted with
RAN2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means that transparent TxD can be at least using UE vendor
declaration and used in testing for Rel-15.</p>
<p>For the signalling, an LS out R4-2103360 was agreed and sent to RAN2
with the following description and action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“1. Overall Description:</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>RAN4 has agreed to introduce a new per-band capability signaling in
Rel-16 for FR1 UEs supporting transparent TxD.</p>
<p>RAN4 would also like to ask RAN2 to enable release-independent
support of this new capability from Rel-15 for PC2, if possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>2. Actions:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>To RAN2:</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> RAN4 respectfully asks RAN2 to define
respective signalling in Rel-16 and discuss release independence to
Rel-15.”</p>
<p>In RAN4#99-e, RAN2 Reply LS was received in R4-2107616, in which the
feasibility of release independency to Rel-15 by allowing early
implementation was confirmed. Further questions were also raised to
about applicable power classes and if there are dependencies with other
capabilities;</p>
<p>“RAN2 thanks RAN4 for the LS on signalling scheme of transparent
TxD.</p>
<p>Regarding the new per-band capability signaling in Rel-16 for FR1 UEs
supporting transparent TxD, RAN2 can add the corresponding capability in
corresponding specification (TS 38.331 and TS 38.306).</p>
<p>RAN2 has discussed whether to enable release-independent support of
this new capability from Rel-15, and the following agreements have been
achieved:</p>
<p>RAN2 can support release independent capability of transparent TxD
for Rel-15, by allowing early implementation of the Rel-16 CRs.</p>
<p>It is possible to only apply the change for this new capability for
PC2 UEs for Rel-15, but RAN2 would like to understand whether the Rel-16
capability signalling applies for all PCs, while Rel-15 capability
signalling applies for just PC2 (as this difference in Rel-15 and Rel-16
capability might impact the signalling design)?</p>
<p>RAN2 would also like to confirm whether this new capability has any
dependencies with other capabilities that should be captured by RAN2
(since the capability is intended as release independent, RAN2 may need
to capture such pre-requisites explicitly).”</p>
<p>The key agreements for TxD and power class related issues were
documented in the agreed WF R4-2107740. The TxD related part is as
following:</p>
<p>In the WF, the applicable power class for capability signaling was
confirmed. However, the dependencies with other capabilities were still
under discussion.</p>
<p><em>LS related - Applicable power class for capability signaling in
different releases</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Proposals:</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Applies for all Power Classes for both Rel-15 and
Rel-16</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Applies for only PC2 for Rel-15, and for all power
classes in Rel-16;</em></p>
<p><em>Option 3: Others</em></p>
<p><em>Agreement (GTW): Option 1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means that RAN4 confirm that the capability singling applies for
all power classes for both Rel-15 and Rel-16.</p>
<p>In RAN4#100-e, the following contents were agreed in the LS out to
RAN2 in R4-2115111 to reflect the previous agreement:</p>
<p>RAN4 would like to confirm the capability of transparent TxD applies
to all power classes equally in all the applicable releases via a
release independent manner.</p>
<p>This has clarified that the power classes would not be differentiated
for release independency.</p>
<p>In addition, during the discussion, RAN2 has made agreements that
Rel-16 CRs would be approved for this TxD capability signalling, thus
conclude the discussion for the release.</p>
<p>In RAN4#108bis, during the discussion of 4Tx feature, it is agreed to
clarify that the legacy per-band TxDiversity capability introduced from
Rel-16 is for 2Tx only in the approved LS R4-2317617.</p>
<h2 id="applicable-release">6.2 Applicable release</h2>
<h3 id="agreements-12">6.2.1 Agreements</h3>
<p>TxD requirements would still in Rel-17 RAN4 specs since it is a
Rel-17 WI, and RAN4 would allow release independency from Rel-15 by
early implementation of the requirements in Rel-17.</p>
<p>RAN2 would introduce the capability signalling in Rel-16 RAN2 spec,
and allow release independency from Rel-15 by early implementation of
Rel-16 CRs.</p>
<h3 id="study-process-12">6.2.2 Study process</h3>
<p>In RAN4#92bis, a WF R4-1913067 was agreed. Though this WF was mainly
for power class issue, there is following contents closely related to
TxD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Transparent TxD UE behaivor is not specified in Rel-15 RAN4 core
requirements</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the explanation of Rel-15 , the Chair’s explanation is this a
“fact” which reflect the situation of that point. From this point, the
need for specific requirements for TxD has been officially confirmed by
RAN4.</p>
<p>In RAN4#93, a reply LS R4-1916132 from RAN5 was received by RAN4. In
the LS, RAN5 reply that it cannot fully evaluate the impact TxD testing
since it’s unclear from RAN4 specification, in this LS RAN5 also this
question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Clarify whether the FR1 Tx diversity applies from Rel.-15 or
Rel.-16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>By the time of RAN4#99, this question and LS was not replied and this
the main impendence of agreements.</p>
<p>In RAN4#94-e-bis, in the agreed WF R4-2005652 for eMIMO, there are
some agreements to confirm TxD should be supported at least from
Rel-16:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Transparent Tx Diversity (TxD) in Rel-16 (TBD its
applicability for UEs supporting or not supporting full power
transmission)</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Transparent TxD shall be allowed for FR1 in Rel-16:</em></p>
<p><em>Necessary changes to Rel-16 RAN4 specification is needed to allow
the UE behavior of transparent TxD in FR1;</em></p>
<p><em>TBD (Accordingly RAN5 will change test cases to allow transparent
TxD)</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a long debate that whether TxD can be supported from Rel-15,
and in RAN4#98-e, there is major break through in this topic with the
TxD capability signlaing and release independency. In the agreed WF
R4-2103390, the following agreements were made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Signaling for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Whether and how RAN4 introduce signalling for transparent
TxD:</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Introduce some sort of signaling by UE</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1a. Use ModifiedMPRbehavior bits to signal additional
relaxations;</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1b: Introducing a new ( per band capability) signalling
for TxD together with existing power classes</em></p>
<p><em>Capability reporting for supporting TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1c: Introducing a new power class (e.g. PC2.5) for
TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Based on UE vendor declaration.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 3: Using existing signalling to indicate the 2Tx
implementation capability.</em></p>
<p><em>Recommended WF</em></p>
<p><em>For R15 UEs, UE vendor declaration can be used in
testing</em></p>
<p><em>For R16 UEs, new signaling, i.e. 1b, is needed to inform the
network of the support of TxD. If the signaling can be made to enable
release-independent support of TxD from R15 can be consulted with
RAN2</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After that the applicable release depend on the release dependency
which was discussed in the capability signaling part.</p>
<p>The remaining study process for capability signalling can be
referenced from clause 6.1.2. RAN2 final agreements are those signalling
would be introduced in Rel-16 RAN2 spec, while allow release
independency from Rel-15 by early implementation of Rel-16 CRs.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the TxD requirements would still in Rel-17
RAN4 specs since it is a Rel-17 WI, and RAN4 would allow release
independency from Rel-15 by early implementation of the requirements in
Rel-17.</p>

in later stage, and effective one would also be captured in previous

basic background for every meeting.</p>
<h2 id="a.1.1-before-ran494-e-bis">A.1.1 Before RAN4#94-e-bis</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<p>Before RAN4#94-e-Bis can be regarded as early stages for the study of
TxD, there is no dedicated agenda for this topic and the papers were
spread across different topics such as maintenance, power class issue
and the eMIMO.</p>
<p><strong>Starting point</strong></p>
<p>The following LS can be regarded as the starting point of
introduction of UL transmission diversity concept for RAN4: In
RAN4#84-Bis Dubrovnik with LS R4-1710109 from RAN1 saying:</p>
<p>“<em>For CP-OFDM waveform based PUSCH, operation with UL transmission
diversity is transparent to specification</em>”.</p>
<p>Later RAN1 also made similar agreements for DFT-s-OFDM. This means UE
is allowed to implement diversity schemes and specifications should not
limit the implementations.</p>
<p><strong>Early stage discussion and agreements:</strong></p>
<p>There were early discussion and agreements of PA architecture for PC2
UE as in R4-1902497 in RAN4#90 documented.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Rel-15, for power class 2 UE PA configurations for UL-MIMO, RAN4
had the following two approved WFs [R4-1803259] and [R4-1816615], and
the key relating parts are listed below respectively:</p>
<p><em>“Only PA configurations of 23+23dBm for UL MIMO and 26dBm for 1Tx
are supported by specification for NR TDD bands for PC2 UE in
Rel-15”</em></p>
<p><em>“Clarify in the Rel-15 specification on ambiguous requirements
for UE supporting UL MIMO</em></p>
<p><em>Maximum output power</em></p>
<p><em>Clarity in the spec that if PC2 UE is configured for transmission
on single-antenna port, the requirements of the same power class in
subclause 6.2.1 apply for the UE.</em></p>
<p><em>How to configure for transmission on single-antenna port is up to
UE implementation”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In RAN4#92, a WF R4-1910343 was agreed in which following agreements
was made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>No specific requirements for TX diversity is written in RAN4
specification.</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 will follow RAN1 agreements and is discussing possibility
for RAN4 requirements to accommodate TX diversity</em></p>
<p><em>LS to RAN5 will be sent to ask them to confirm feasibility of TX
diversity testing</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mentioned LS to RAN5 R4-1910344 has been agreed to inform RAN5
about the discussion on introducing Tx diversity requirements in FR1
(see R4-1908472 and R4-1909922) and ask RAN5 about the potential
testability issues with Tx diversity. In the LS it was stated that:</p>
<p>“<em>During the discussion, concerns have been raised about the
testability of this feature, since UEs may utilize multiple antennas
during its uplink transmission. Considering the usage of the Tx
diversity scheme is up to the UE implementation, it may also be unknown
which uplink transmit antennas a UE uses at a certain point in
time.</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 respectfully asks RAN5 to identify potential issues with the
testability of this feature, taking into account uplink transmission
from multiple potentially unknown UE antenna connectors.”</em>.</p>
<p>In RAN4#92bis, a WF R4-1913067 was agreed. Though this WF was mainly
for power class issue, there is following contents closely related to
TxD:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Transparent TxD UE behaivor is not specified in Rel-15 RAN4 core
requirements</em></p>
<p><em>Further work needed in Rel-16 and impact on RAN5 conformance
testing investigateg, e.g, replacement of ”antenna connector” with
”antenna port”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the explanation of Rel-15 , the Chair’s explanation is this a
“fact” which reflect the situation of that point. From this point, the
need for specific requirements for TxD has been officially confirmed by
RAN4.</p>
<p>In RAN4#93, a reply LS R4-1916132 from RAN5 was received by RAN4. In
the LS, RAN5 reply that it cannot fully evaluate the impact TxD testing
since it’s unclear from RAN4 specification:</p>
<p><em>“RAN5 has discussed the issues presented in the LS and has come
to the conclusion that it currently cannot fully evaluate the impact of
Tx diversity on UE testing, since in RAN5 understanding Tx diversity
requirements are unclear from RAN4 specification. To fully judge the
impact of Tx diversity on testing and test system design, RAN5 requires
defined requirements which need to be tested and/or an understanding of
the expected UE behaviour to be tested, since the Tx diversity behaviour
of the UE may impact also TC other than Tx, e.g. RRM, Demod, CSI as
outlined in [1].”</em></p>
<p>RAN5 also asked some specific questions to RAN4:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Define requirements for FR1 Tx diversity and clarify whether the
requirements apply at a UE or at the antenna connector level.</em></p>
<p><em>Confirm that the RAN5 assumption of a maximum of 2 UL antenna
connectors for Tx diversity is correct.</em></p>
<p><em>Clarify whether the FR1 Tx diversity applies from Rel.-15 or
Rel.-16.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same meeting RAN4#93, a Rel-15 CR R4-1916137 for clarification
of ENDC power class in R15 has been agreed in which clarification was
added for the scenario that UE supports PC2 SA NR with 2x23 dBm PAs will
report PC2 for NR even though it only support PC3 for NR in EN-DC if UE
do not declare support of 2-layer for EN-DC on this NR band:</p>
<p><em>” <u>Unless otherwise stated, if UE indicates IE
maxNumberSRS-Ports-PerResource = n2 in NR standalone operation mode, the
said UE shall meet the NR requirements for either power class 2 or power
class 3 in EN-DC within FR1 if UE indicates IE
maxNumberSRS-Ports-PerResource = n1 for EN-DC on this NR
band.</u></em>”</p>
<p>This has become a “famuous sentence” in RAN4 for a long time since it
creats a lot of controversies in upcoming meetings.</p>
<p>In RAN4#94, no agreements were made.</p>
<h2 id="a.1.2-ran494-e-bis">A.1.2 RAN4#94-e-bis</h2>
<p>In this meeting, the TxD discussion were in two Email threads,
UL-MIMO related power class and eMIMO.</p>
<p>In the agreed WF R4-2005652 for eMIMO, there are some agreements
regarding the TxD applicability and relationship with eMIMO
features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Transparent Tx Diversity (TxD) in Rel-16 (TBD its
applicability for UEs supporting or not supporting full power
transmission)</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Transparent TxD shall be allowed for FR1 in Rel-16:</em></p>
<p><em>Necessary changes to Rel-16 RAN4 specification is needed to allow
the UE behavior of transparent TxD in FR1;</em></p>
<p><em>TBD (Accordingly RAN5 will change test cases to allow transparent
TxD)</em></p>
<p><em>From Rel-16 and beyond, SA UE declaring PC2 HPUE shall have 26dBm
MOP for both 1TX port transmission and 2TX UL-MIMO (if
supported)</em></p>
<p><em>For UE with 23dBm+23dBm PA architecture, transparent TxD shall be

</blockquote>
<p>In addition, there is the following agreement documented in the
Chairman’s notes under this WF:</p>
<p>“The applicability of Transparent TxD is NOT related to UE supporting
or not supporting Rel-16 ULFPTx.”</p>
<p>The detailed discussion can be referenced to the Email discussion
summary R4-2005695.</p>
<p>In the power class related discussion, a WF R4-2005216 was agreed and
the contents is as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Requirements for SA UL MIMO PC2 UE are incomplete/ambiguous
in current R15 RAN4 specs</strong><em>.</em></p>
<p><em>Option1: Continue discussion to complete in R15.</em></p>
<p><em>Option2: Live with what we have now in r15, continue discussion

</blockquote>
<p>Basically there is no concrete agreements related to either TxD or
power class issue. It should be noted that in R4-2003028, there is more
background for power class issue, and could be used as further reference
for earlier power class related background.</p>
<p>The Email summary can be reference to R4-2005687.</p>
<h2 id="a.1.3-ran495-e">A.1.3 RAN4#95-e</h2>
<p>The main agreements in this meeting was made under the eMIMO WI, and
the discussion of R15 power class didn’t have an WF in this meeting.
There is an incoming LS R4-2006116 from GCF was received for
clarfication of several power class inalignment issues from the views of
GCF.</p>
<p>In agreed WF R4-2008462, there is the following agreements in
transparent TxD applicability related to ULFPTx</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Transparent TxD’s applicability for UEs supporting or not
supporting ULFPTx in Rel-16</strong></em></p>
<p><em>[Reconfirm previous agreement] “The applicability of Transparent
TxD is NOT related to UE supporting or not supporting Rel-16
ULFPTx”</em></p>
<p><em>[Newly added] In Rel-16, RAN4 <strong>ULFPTx</strong> requirement
needs to allow UE to use transparent TxD to achieve the required
transmission power in following cases:</em></p>
<p><em>Mode-1 UE use transparent TxD for single SRS port (either with
DCI_0_0 or single SRS port with DCI_0_1)</em></p>
<p><em>FFS transparent TxD can be used for UE configured with two SRS
ports</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An LS R4-2009171 was agreed and sent to RAN1, in order to make
progress of certain discussion of transparent TxD related issues, to get
some clarification from RAN1. The contents are as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In RAN4 study of ULFPTx under eMIMO WI, enabling transparent Tx
diversity (TxD) was agreed at least from Rel-16, and the applicability
of transparent TxD is NOT related to UE supporting or not supporting
Rel-16 ULFPTx. Two possible cases were identified in RAN4 to use
transparent TxD to achieve the required transmission power, i.e. for a
FR1 UE having two TX branches/antennae,</em></p>
<p><em>First case: Transparent TxD for UE configured with single SRS
port (either with DCI_0_0 or single SRS port with DCI_0_1);</em></p>
<p><em>Second case: Transparent TxD for UE configured with 2 SRS ports
(FFS whether TxD is feasible in this case).</em></p>
<p><em>For the second case, two possible methods to transmit a
multi-port SRS resource (i.e. 2Tx ports) with two PAs (PA1 and PA2) were
considered, i.e.</em></p>
<p><em>Method-1: SRS port-1 maps to PA1, SRS port-2 maps to PA2</em></p>
<p><em>Method-2: SRS port-1 maps to PA1+PA2, SRS port-2 maps to
PA1+PA2</em></p>
<p><em>In order to make progress of corresponding discussion of
transparent TxD related issues, RAN4 would like to get some
clarification from RAN1 for the feasibility of the second case.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Question 1</strong>: Whether the two mentioned methods
are both feasible to transmit the full output power?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Question 2</strong>: If answer is yes, which ULFPTx modes
can be supported for these two methods?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In agreed WF R4-2008465, though not much agreements, many TxD
specific issues were raised and options provided. From this point, the
discussion for TxD become more speed up and more systematic.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Issue 3-3-1: Summing the power and emissions</em></p>
<p><em>Motivation is to define requirements so that power is measured
correctly for all implementations</em></p>

<p><em>Option 2: Define “measured as the sum of the emissions from all

<p><em>Option 3: Measured per antenna connector against a 3 dB tighter
emissions requirement per connector (for two antenna
connectors).</em></p>
<p><em>Issue 3-3-3: ACLR for Transparent TxD</em></p>

<p><em>Option 1a: TE needs to detect all antenna connectors for ACK and

case</em></p>
<p><em>What is the motivation for RAN4 to disallow this? Or power

<p>Among them actually only <em>Issue 3-3-3 and Issue 3-3-4</em> are
agreements without different options, and issue 3-3-4 was gradually
reversed in later stage.</p>
<p>The Email summary for eMIMO and R15 power class can be found in
R4-2008946 and R4-2008935.</p>
<h2 id="a.1.4-ran88-e">A.1.4 RAN#88-e</h2>
<p>The power class ambiguity issue for Rel-16 was raised in RAN#88-e in
RP-201032. The solution of introducing specific RAN2 signalling was
agreed and an LS RP-201392 was approved.</p>
<p>The power class for NR band in MR-DC could be different from that
indicated in SA mode. If the power class of NR part is reported for the
MR-DC, the UE shall meet the NR requirements for power class indicated
by the newly introduced IE. The NR power class in Pcmax should then use
the one indicated by the new IE instead.The Rel-16 EN-DC power class
ambiguity problem related to TxD was solved.</p>
<h2 id="a.1.5-ran496-e">A.1.5 RAN4#96-e</h2>
<p>In this meeting, TxD related requirements were mainly discussed with
power class related issue in one thread.</p>
<p>There is one agreed WF R4-2011768 in which the following agreements
were made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Summing the Powers and Emissions</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 agree to define requirements for MOP and emission so that
power is measured correctly for all implementations, including UE with
transparent TxD:</em></p>
<p><em>Use “requirements are defined as the sum of powers from both
connectors”.</em></p>
<p><em>This shall be interpreted as: Measure the power and emissions per
connector and then sum them up afterwards.</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 will clean-up all requirements related to summing the powers
and emissions, including UL MIMO, UL full power transmission
requirement.</em></p>
<p><em>MPR Requirement for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 agree MPR defined for TxD is applied to the total output
power rather than at each antenna connector</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For EVM, in response to newly raised proposals, the WF has the
following update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>EVM Requirement for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Background:</em></p>
<p><em>In RAN4#95e, RAN4 agree to define EVM for transparent TxD
as:</em></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[EVM = \sqrt{(P_{1}*{EVM}_{1}^{2} + \
P_{2}*{EVM}_{2}^{2})/(P1\  + \ P2)}\]</span></p>
<p><em>RAN4 further study new test method and EVM definition proposed in
R4-2011519:</em></p>
<p><em>FFS whether or not to use new EVM definition to replace above
definition.</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 agree the location in Specification to capture EVM
definition for transparent TxD, as</em></p>
<p><em>Annex F</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For other issues, different options were raised and basically no
agreements and progress were made, the titles were included below while
the details were omitted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Declaration for Default TX Connector</em></p>
<p><em>UE Behavior under Conformance Testing</em></p>
<p><em>Power Splitting Behavior</em></p>
<p><em>Signaling for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Applicability of Transparent TxD Requirement</em></p>
<p><em>CDD-related Requirement</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For power class related issues, a LS was sent back to GCF in
R4-2011903 to clarify the Rel-16 status for the power class issues,
while the Rel-15 remains to be discussed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“”RAN4 thanks GCF CAG for the LS on power class ambiguities in
RAN4 specification and would like to inform GCF CAG about the latest
progress.</em></p>
<p><em>1. It is agreed that new power class capability signalling for NR
in EN-DC is introduced in Rel-16 to distinguish power class capability
of NR in EN-DC from power class capability of NR in SA.</em></p>
<p><em>2. It is agreed that Rel-16 UE shall meet same power class
requirements between single antenna port mode and UL MIMO in
SA.</em></p>
<p><em>3. It is agreed that transparent Tx diversity (TxD) is enabled at
least from Rel-16 RAN4 specification.</em></p>
<p><em>RAN4 will inform GCF about the progress of Rel-15 power class
clarification, once consensus is reached.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The detailed Email summary is in R4-2011860.</p>
<p>In addition, a draft CR to reflect the agreements of new UE
capability signalling to reflect the power class for NR band in MR-DC
could be different from that indicated in SA mode was technically
endorsed in R4-2011770. The contribution was discussed during email
thread [96e][121] NR_R16_Maintenance. The discussion was recorded in
R4-2011861.</p>
<p>For eMIMO, reply LS R4-2013040 was received from RAN1 in that the
following answers were provided:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Question 1: Whether the two mentioned methods are both feasible
to transmit the full output power?</em></p>
<p><em>Answer 1: From RAN1’s perspective, both Method-1 and Method-2 can
be supported for UL full power transmission.</em></p>
<p><em>For two SRS port transmission in method-2, the UE will need to
transmit two SRS ports on each PA in a symbol, while for method-1 each
PA carries one SRS port.</em></p>
<p><em>Question 2: If answer is yes, which ULFPTx modes can be supported
for these two methods?</em></p>
<p><em>Answer 2: From RAN1’s perspective, Method-1 can be supported for
any UL full power transmission modes, and Method-2 can be supported at
least for Mode-2 and Mode-full power (i.e., the other mode).</em></p>
<p><em>Question 3: Whether the ULFPTx mode-2 and the other ULPFTx mode
are feasible for FR2 UE?</em></p>
<p><em>Answer 3: From RAN1’s perspective, UL full power modes {Mode-1,
Mode-2 and Mode-full power (i.e., the other mode)} can be supported for
FR2.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can be seen that RAN1 do not mandate any implementation for those
modes.</p>
<p>The previously endorsed feature CRs was officially agreed for
38.101-1 and 38.101-2 in R4-2011762 and R4-2011920 respectively. Some
remaining issues were put into maintenance stage from next meeting as
documented in the chairman’s notes:</p>
<p><em>“The Chairmain commented that for PC2 and PC3, MPR issues related
to 2TX, including UL-MIMO, uplink full power transmission, and TxD, will
be further discussed in TEI16.”</em></p>

<h2 id="a.1.6-ran497-e">A.1.6 RAN4#97-e</h2>
<p>In RAN4#97-e meeting, the transparent TxD was discussed under TEI16
as documented in [R4-2016959] and a WF [R4-2016830] was also agreed. The
agreements reached are as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Declaration for Default TX Connector</em></p>
<p><em>UE declares which connectors will be active per band under test.
TE needs to detect ACK and NACK and any other expected response from UE
from all declared TX antenna connectors.</em></p>
<p><em>The word “active” can be replaced by “used for TxD during one
test procedure”. (Not necessarily to have transmission all the
time.)</em></p>
<p><em>UE declaration needs to describe exact two antenna connectors
under test.</em></p>
<p><em>MPR for Transparent and UL MIMO</em></p>
<p><em>Whether 2 Tx MPR should be the same MPR requirement for TX
Diversity and UL MIMO for the same power class.</em></p>
<p><em>Agreement</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Yes</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are still divided views and some new options were also
discussed. The main points including:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>New EVM definition for transparent TxD</p>
<p>UE behavior on keeping the tx diversity under conformance testing</p>
<p>UE behaviour for power splitting</p>
<p>Signaling for Transparent TxD</p>
<p>Applicability of TxD procedure &amp; requirements</p>
<p>Necessity of CDD related requirement</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, there is a long standing RAN5 LS in [R4-1916132] that
have not been replied. One draft reply was prepared in [R4-2015321] but
was not discussed.</p>
<p>For power class related issue, still no concrete agreements can be
reached, the following topic was discussed and only limited progress was
made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RAN4 clarification of NSA NR power class (Rel-15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Email summary is referenced to R4-2016959 .</p>
<p>For eMIMO and ULFPTx related, there is only very few maintenance
remains and only MPR was discussed. The agreement reached is as
following:</p>
<p><em>“Chair: It is agreed that one set of MPR requirements should be
adopted for both UL MIMO (including ULFPTx) and TxD”</em></p>
<p>The email summary is R4-2016955.</p>
<h2 id="a.1.7-ran498-e">A.1.7 RAN4#98-e</h2>
<p>In RAN4#98-e, there are major break through in this topic, and there
are clear agreements and WF for TxD signaling and release independency.
In the agreed WF R4-2103390, the following agreements were made:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Signaling for Transparent TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Whether and how RAN4 introduce signalling for transparent
TxD:</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Introduce some sort of signaling by UE</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1a. Use ModifiedMPRbehavior bits to signal additional
relaxations;</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1b: Introducing a new ( per band capability) signalling
for TxD together with existing power classes</em></p>
<p><em>Capability reporting for supporting TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1c: Introducing a new power class (e.g. PC2.5) for
TxD</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Based on UE vendor declaration.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 3: Using existing signalling to indicate the 2Tx
implementation capability.</em></p>
<p><em>Recommended WF</em></p>
<p><em>For R15 UEs, UE vendor declaration can be used in
testing</em></p>
<p><em>For R16 UEs, new signaling, i.e. 1b, is needed to inform the
network of the support of TxD. If the signaling can be made to enable
release-independent support of TxD from R15 can be consulted with
RAN2</em></p>
<p><em>CDD-related Requirement</em></p>
<p><em>For transparent TxD UE, necessity of CDD related requirements,
e.g. requirement on TAE+CDD, is need to be further studied:</em></p>
<p><em>Proposals</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Yes</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: No.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2b. No at least for Rel-16</em></p>
<p><em>Recommended WF</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2b</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the signalling, an LS out R4-2103360 was agreed and sent to RAN2
with the following description and action:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>“1. Overall Description:</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>RAN4 has agreed to introduce a new per-band capability signaling in
Rel-16 for FR1 UEs supporting transparent TxD.</p>
<p>RAN4 would also like to ask RAN2 to enable release-independent
support of this new capability from Rel-15 for PC2, if possible.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>2. Actions:</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>To RAN2:</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>ACTION:</strong> RAN4 respectfully asks RAN2 to define
respective signalling in Rel-16 and discuss release independence to
Rel-15.”</p>
<p>For testing related UE behaviour and power splitting behaviour, this
meeting is the last meeting to list the detailed options in the WF, and
though NO AGREEMENTS for any solution could be reached, they could still
be considered as future discussion basis which is as following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UE Behavior under Conformance Testing</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Motivation is to guide how to test requirements that
require power changes such as relative power control.</p>
<p>Proposals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Option 1a: UE will keep the tx diversity status unchanged in
conformance testing.</p>
<p>Option 1b: Test mode signalling is implemented to instruct UE to keep
TX div status unchanged</p>
<p>Option 2a: TE will detect and sum for every power step and change in
condition from <strong>declared</strong> connector, with no
precondition</p>
<p>Option 2b: TE will detect and sum for every power step and change in
condition from <strong>declared</strong> connector, based on
pre-condition that a repeatability of TxD activation/deactivation timing
in a UE is maintained can be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Power Splitting Behavior</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Background: Motivation is to guide how to test requirements that
require power changes such as relative power control</p>
<p>Question 1: What would be the impact for the requirements and
testability with tentative equal power split restriction?</p>
<p>Proposals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Option 1: Only allow equal power split between connectors</p>
<p>Excludes 17+17+20 dBm implementations</p>
<p>Excludes power control optimizations</p>
<p>Option 1a: Per instructed as test mode, UE should keep equal power
split between connectors in all cases.</p>
<p>Option 2: Allow any power split between connectors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A draft CR for 38.101-1 was also technically endorsed. Howver, there
are still unsolved issues such as MPR and the draft CR would be
continuiously discussed an updated in next meeting.</p>
<p>For power class issue, some more issues were raised without
proguress.</p>
<p>The Email discussion summary is in R4-2103302.</p>
<p>There is no more discussion in eMIMO agenda.</p>
<h2 id="a.1.8-ran498-e-bis">A.1.8 RAN4#98-e-bis</h2>

agreements in EVM and the need for futher MPR evaluation, There are also
discussion on SRS antenna switching and some preliminary agreements were
made.</p>

<p>For the Rel-15 NSA power class issue, there is no progress and
companies are waiting for RAN2’s feed back about the release
independency to Rel-15:</p>
<p><em>”Wait for feedback from Ran2 or wait for ran2 to conclude the
work to add TX diversity capability and conclusion on applicable
release.”</em></p>
<p>Another WF R4-2105331 is MPR evaluation assumptions, it is agreed
that an evaluation is necessary to further progress the MPR work, and a
detailed assumptions were agreed:</p>
<p><em>WF on architecture</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>PC2 with 2x23dBm PAs =&gt; 2Tx NR MPR (High priority)</em></p>
<p><em>[PC2 with 2x26dBm PAs =&gt; 2Tx NR MPR]</em></p>
<p><em>[PC2 with 23+26dBm PAs =&gt; 2Tx NR MPR]</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>WF: MPR/AMPR evaluation assumptions (1)</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>RF assumptions:</em></p>
<p><em>4dB post PA losses</em></p>
<p><em>10dB antenna isolation</em></p>
<p><em>Equal power and Equal back-off power split for the two
antennas</em></p>
<p><em>Usual 3GPP PA calibration for 20MHz QPSK DFT-s-OFDM 100RB0
waveform based on 4dB post PA losses and 1dB MPR.</em></p>
<p><em>For 26dBm PA: 29dBm at 31dB ACLR</em></p>
<p><em>For 23dBm PA: 26dBm at 30dB ACLR</em></p>
<p><em>RF impairments:</em></p>
<p><em>Image and carrier leakage is 28dB for up to 64QAM, image is 35dB
for 256QAM</em></p>
<p><em>CIM3 is 60dB and CIM5 is 70dB</em></p>
<p><em>Measurements/simulation is used where two PA are coupled at their
outputs recreating the 10dB antenna isolation assumption with the
Reverse IMD</em></p>
<p><em>To recreate the effect of CDD the two signal on each antennas can
simply have a small delay between each other (a fraction of CP)</em></p>
<p><em>Requirements for back-off evaluation:</em></p>
<p><em>Emission requirements (ACLR/SEM/spurious emissions of the
targeted power class) are checked by summing the power of the two
transmit paths</em></p>
<p><em>EVM is checked for the agreed composite EVM equation but with P1

order modulations where RIMD will further degrade the in channel noise
floor.</em></p>
<p><em>Whether IBE is checked per antenna or as the sum should be
clearly stated</em></p>

<p><em>Evaluation scenarios:</em></p>
<p><em>Both CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM waveforms are evaluated</em></p>
<p><em>Since simulation may not be available, at least some worst case
corners are evaluated for inner/outer and edge allocations</em></p>
<p><em>Since it has the tighter requirements and highest PSD the lowest
valid SCS should be used.</em></p>
<p><em>All modulation orders should be checked:</em></p>

<p>In this meeting, RAN2 Reply LS was received in R4-2107616, in which
the feasibility of release independency to Rel-15 by allowing early
implementation was confirmed. Further questions were also raised to
about applicable power classes and if there are dependencies with other
capabilities;</p>
<p><em>“RAN2 thanks RAN4 for the LS on signalling scheme of transparent
TxD.</em></p>
<p><em>Regarding the new per-band capability signaling in Rel-16 for FR1
UEs supporting transparent TxD, RAN2 can add the corresponding
capability in corresponding specification (TS 38.331 and TS
38.306).</em></p>
<p><em>RAN2 has discussed whether to enable release-independent support
of this new capability from Rel-15, and the following agreements have
been achieved:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>RAN2 can support release independent capability of transparent
TxD for Rel-15, by allowing early implementation of the Rel-16
CRs.</em></p>
<p><em>It is possible to only apply the change for this new capability
for PC2 UEs for Rel-15, but RAN2 would like to understand whether the
Rel-16 capability signalling applies for all PCs, while Rel-15
capability signalling applies for just PC2 (as this difference in Rel-15
and Rel-16 capability might impact the signalling design)?</em></p>
<p><em>RAN2 would also like to confirm whether this new capability has
any dependencies with other capabilities that should be captured by RAN2
(since the capability is intended as release independent, RAN2 may need
to capture such pre-requisites explicitly).”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key agreements for TxD and power class related issues were
documented in the agreed WF R4-2107740. The TxD related part is as
following:</p>
<p>In the WF, the applicable power class for capability signaling was
confirmed. However, the dependencies with other capabilities were still
under discussion.</p>
<p><em>LS related - Applicable power class for capability signaling in
different releases</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Proposals:</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Applies for all Power Classes for both Rel-15 and
Rel-16</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Applies for only PC2 for Rel-15, and for all power
classes in Rel-16;</em></p>
<p><em>Option 3: Others</em></p>
<p><em>Agreement (GTW): Option 1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the MPR, there is no agreement reached and only very wide ranges
were proposed. This need to be further discussed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this meeting, RAN4 will try to agree on the ranges for MPR values
if possible, and in the next meeting, RAN4 can down-select to concrete
value within the agreed range.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New agreements were reached on TxD EVM spectrum flatness;</p>
<p><em>Remaining Issues - TxD EVM spectrum flatness</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Agreements</em></p>
<p><em>Based on R4-2108793 with the following updated equation for
composite equalizer:</em></p>

<p><span class="math display">\[EC(f) = \frac{P_{1}{\  \bullet
|EC}_{1}(f)| + {P_{2}\  \bullet |EC}_{2}(f)|}{P_{1} +
P_{2}}\]</span></p>
<p>The two controversial testing related issues were moved to RAN5.</p>
<p><em>Remaining Issues - Testing related issues</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Proposals</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Leave these discussions to RAN5 and not pursue them
before agreement of RAN4 CR.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Continue discussion in RAN4.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Agreement:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Option 1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Remaining Issues - TxD antenna and channel models</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Proposals</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: No more discussion on these issues.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Further discuss the relevant antenna and channel models
and their impact as part of, and prior to, concluding on conformance
testing methodologies and reference receivers for TxD with conducted
measurements.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Agreements:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Option 1</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Significant progress for power class issues were reached in this
meeting, since there is a confirmation of feasibility of release
independency of TxD from Rel-15.</p>
<p>For Rel-15 EN-DC power class issue, i.e. the “famous sentence”, a
draft CR R4-2107781 was endorsed, in which the description of multiple
power class possibilities for NR part of NSA in Rel-15 was confined only
be allowed in case TxD is supported and signaled. In case TxD was not
indicated by signaling, the current behaviour of multiple power class
possibilities for NR part of NSA can be removed.</p>
<p>For Rel-15 SA power class issue, an agreement was reached in
R4-2107740,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Power class related- Fallback to 1-port Tx for SA in
Rel-15</em></p>
<p><em>Proposals</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: Confirm ue-PowerClass should always be supported for
1-port transmission fall back mode for SA in Rel-15.</em></p>
<p><em>UE do not support TxD capability would equip a full power
chain</em></p>
<p><em>For UE support TxD capability, when falls back to 1-port
transmission, it is also reasonable to suppose it would use TxD to
achieve ue-PowerClass in standalone mode</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: Others</em></p>
<p><em>Tentative agreements:</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1</em></p>
<p><em>Discuss in next meeting whether Rel-15 CR would be introduced to
clarify the understanding</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, there is still no conclusion for Pcmax for NR for Rel-15
EN-DC, which is also documented in R4-2107740,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Power class related- The Pcmax for NR for Rel-15 EN-DC</em></p>
<p><em>Proposals</em></p>
<p><em>Option 1: The Pcmax for NR is modified to use the lower possible
power class to decide the lower bound of the configured power.
(Huawei)</em></p>
<p><em>Option 2: The Pcmax for NR is modified according to the declared
NR power capability for NSA so that the PHR becomes correct.
(Ericsson)</em></p>
<p><em>Option 3:Do not consider further refinements of Pcmax for
NR.</em></p>
<p><em>Option 4: Others</em></p>
<p><em>Agreements :</em></p>
<p><em>FFS</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition, there is another specific agreed WF for SRS antenna
switching requirements for TxD in R4-2107981, since this is a
complicated issue that needs further discussion. The following
agreements were captured:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>In GTW, the following are agreed</em></p>
<p><em>SRS antenna switching which was targeted for DL CSI would not use
UL antenna virtualization, i.e. UL TxD</em></p>
<p><em>SRS antenna switching functionality cannot be excluded for UE
supporting TxD.</em></p>
<p><em>And Chair guidance:</em></p>
<p><em>Leave discussion on concrete value for loss and how to combine
Option 1 and 2 to further email discussion.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Agreed WF</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Introduce PC1.5 to spec</em></p>
<p><em>Explicit introduce TxD for SRS antenna switching IL, but how to
harmonize with the current SRS conditions are FFS, and the exact IL
values are FFS</em></p>
<p><em>At least following PC2 UE architectures with TxD but without
antenna virtualization for all antenna ports are to be analyzed in
#100e</em></p>
<p><em>23PA+23PA</em></p>
<p><em>26PA+23PA</em></p>
<p><em>26PA+26PA</em></p>
<p><em>At least 1T2R, 1T4R, 2T4R and 1T4R/2T4R srs-TxSwitch are to be
analyzed in #100e</em></p>
<p><em>A big CR will be used to capture the agreement in #100e together
with other TxD issues.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are also more detailed background and reference paper in the
WF.</p>
<p>The previous endorsed general TxD draft CR were also updated in this
meeting as R4-2107782, however it was postponed in this meeting, since
there are some items were deemed not included yet.</p>
