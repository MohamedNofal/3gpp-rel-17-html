<h1 id="introduction">4 Introduction</h1>
<p>At the 3GPP TSG RAN #71 meeting, the Study Item description on " New
SID Proposal: Study on New Radio Access Technology " was approved (see
Annex A). The study item covers technology components to be considered
for new radio access technologies, e.g. to fulfil the requirements on
IMT-2020. This technical report covers all RAN aspects of these
technology components.</p>
<h1 id="deployment-scenario">5 Deployment scenario</h1>
<p>A very large set of deployment scenarios (deployment scenarios for
eMBB, mMTC, URLLC, eV2X) are foreseen, as described in 38.913 [9]
section 6.1:</p>
<p>In order to enable the large number of possibilities, the RAN
architecture will support the following:</p>
<p>- Non-centralised deployment: In this scenario, the full NR protocol
stack is supported at the gNB e.g. in a macro deployment or indoor
hotspot environment (could be public or enterprise).</p>
<p>- Centralized deployment: In this scenario, the upper layers of the
NR radio stacks are centralized at the Central Unit. Different protocol
split options between Central Unit and lower layers of gNB nodes may be
possible. The functional split between the Central Unit and lower layers
of gNB nodes may depend on the transport layer. High performance
transport between the Central Unit and lower layers of gNB nodes, e.g.
optical networks, can enable advanced CoMP schemes and scheduling
optimization, which could be useful in high capacity scenarios, or
scenarios where cross cell coordination is beneficial. Low performance
transport between the Central Unit and lower layers of gNB nodes can
enable the higher protocol layers of the NR radio stacks to be supported
in the Central Unit, since the higher protocol layers have lower
performance requirements on the transport layer in terms of bandwidth,
delay, synchronization and jitter.</p>
<p>- Co-sited deployment with E-UTRA: In this scenario the NR
functionality is co-sited with E-UTRA functionality either as part of
the same base station or as multiple base stations at the same site.
Co-sited deployment can be applicable in all NR deployment scenarios
e.g. Urban Macro. In this scenario it is desirable to fully utilise all
spectrum resources assigned to both RATs by means of load balancing or
connectivity via multiple RATs (e.g. utilising lower frequencies as
coverage layer for users on cell edge).</p>
<p>- Shared RAN deployment: NR should support shared RAN deployments,
supporting multiple hosted Core Operators. The Shared RAN could cover
large geographical areas, as in the case of national or regional network
sharing. The Shared RAN coverage could also be heterogeneous, i.e.
limited to few or many smaller areas, for example in the case of Shared
in-building RANs. A shared RAN should be able to efficiently
interoperate with a non-shared RAN. Each Core Operator may have their
own non-shared RAN serving areas adjacent to the Shared RAN. Mobility
between the non-shared RAN and the Shared RAN shall be supported in a
way at least as good as for LTE. The Shared RAN may (as for the case of
LTE) operate either on shared spectrum or on the spectrum of each hosted
Operator.</p>
<p>The RAN architecture will support following scenarios for
connectivity between RAN consisting of E-UTRA and NR, and a CN
consisting of an NGC and an EPC. The connectivity scenario in figure 5-1
includes support for deployment with LTE eNB connected to the EPC with
Non-standalone NR. The connectivity scenario in figure 5-2 includes
support for deployment with gNB connected to the NGC either as
standalone or with Non-standalone E-UTRA, and deployment with LTE eNB
connected to the NGC either as standalone or with Non-standalone NR.</p>

<p><img src="media/image4.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 5-2: E-UTRA and NR connected to the NGC</p>
<h1 id="forward-compatibility">6 Forward compatibility</h1>
<p>Forward compatibility of NR shall ensure smooth introduction of
future services and features while efficient access of the earlier
services and UEs in the same spectrum is still ensured.</p>
<p>In order to ensure forward compatibility of NR, explicit signaling to
NR UEs can indicate reserved resources. At least some reserved resources
are indicated by using at least RRC signaling.</p>
<p>For RAN3 RAN internal interfaces and the RAN-CN interface, forwards
compatibility of the protocol is assured by extension mechanisms such as
those described in chapter 10 of 25- and 36-series application protocol
specifications on message and IE level whenever existing messages are
reused.</p>
<h1
id="radio-interface-protocol-architecture-for-next-generation-radio">7
Radio interface protocol architecture for next generation radio</h1>
<p>To support tight interworking between LTE and NR, a technology of
aggregating data flows between the two RATs is studied based on Dual
Connectivity (DC) for LTE [12]. In DC between LTE and NR, both (e)LTE
eNB and NR gNB can act as a master node as described in sub-clause
4.1.2.1, 4.1.2.2 and 4.1.2.3. It is assumed that DC between LTE and NR
supports the deployment scenario where LTE eNB is not synchronised with
NR gNB.</p>
<p>For NR, a technology of aggregating NR carriers is studied. Both
lower layer aggregation like Carrier Aggregation (CA) for LTE (see [12])
and upper layer aggregation like DC are investigated. From layer 2/3
point of view, aggregation of carriers with different numerologies is
supported in NR. Radio interface protocols for NR are designed flexibly
to allow the possibility of intra-frequency DC and
Multi-Connectivity.</p>
<p>In this sub-clause, the radio interface protocol architecture of NR
is described for the user plane and the control plane encompassing DC
between LTE and NR, and lower/higher layer aggregation of NR
carriers.</p>

above PDCP as described in sub-clause 9.5.</p>

Bearer types for Dual Connectivity between LTE and NR</h3>
<p>The following three types of bearer are supported for Dual
Connectivity between LTE and NR regardless of the connected CN, except
for the split bearer via SCG where the master node is gNB (i.e. NR):</p>
<p>- Split bearer via MCG as illustrated in Figure 7.1.2-1 (similar to
option 3C);</p>
<p>- SCG bearer as illustrated in Figure 7.1.2-2 (similar to option
1A);</p>
<p>- Split bearer via SCG as illustrated in Figure 7.1.2-3, where the
split occurs in the secondary node.</p>

the reconfiguration of bearer types, the following cases are
supported:</p>

<p>- reconfiguration of an SCG bearer between two secondary nodes;</p>
<p>- reconfiguration between an MCG bearer and an MCG split bearer.</p>

id="control-plane-architecture-for-dual-connectivity-between-lte-and-nr">7.2.2
Control plane architecture for Dual Connectivity between LTE and NR</h3>
<p>In DC between LTE and NR, the secondary node owns its radio resources
and is primary responsible for allocating radio resources of it cells.
To enable this, some coordination is required between the master node
and the secondary node no matter whether the master RAT is LTE and the
secondary RAT is NR, or vice versa.</p>
<p>The following RRC functions are at least relevant when
(re)configuring secondary node cells to the UE in coordination with the
master node:</p>
<p>- Common radio resource configurations on secondary node cells;</p>
<p>- Dedicated radio resource configurations on secondary node
cells;</p>
<p>- Measurement and mobility control for secondary node cells.</p>
<p>When DC between LTE and NR is configured for a UE, the UE has a
single RRC state machine based on the master node RAT. In this
operation, single C-plane connection is established towards CN. With
these principles, Figure 7.2.2-1 illustrates the C-plane architectures
for DC between LTE and NR. Each node has its own RRC entity which can
generate RRC PDUs and inter-node PDUs using ASN.1. RRC PDUs and
inter-node PDUs generated by the secondary node are embedded with RRC
PDUs generated by the master node which are transported via the master
node to the UE for the first configuration, and for the secondary node
RRC reconfiguration requiring the master node RRC reconfiguration and
vice versa. The master node needs not to modify or add the UE
configurations for the secondary node.</p>
<p>The UE can be configured to establish an SRB in SCG to enable RRC
PDUs for the secondary node to be sent directly between the UE and the
secondary node. RRC PDUs for the secondary node can be transported
directly to the UE for the secondary node RRC reconfiguration not
requiring any coordination with the master node. Alternatively, it can
be delivered embedded within RRC PDUs generated by the master node,
which is up to the network implementation. Measurement reporting for
mobility within the secondary node can be done directly from the UE to
the secondary node if an SCG SRB is configured. Support of the direct
RRC PDU transmission between the UE and the secondary node does not
imply that the UE has to do any reordering of RRC messages.</p>
<p>Split SRB is supported for DC between LTE and NR no matter which RAT
is the master. In other words, C-plane packet duplication is supported
in LTE/NR PDCP.</p>
<p><img src="media/image12.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 7.2.2-1: C-plane architecture for Dual Connectivity between
LTE and NR</p>
<h4 id="ue-capability-coordination-between-lte-and-nr">7.2.2.1 UE
capability coordination between LTE and NR</h4>
<p>For a UE supporting both LTE and NR, the UE reports its capability
information for both LTE and NR respectively, which are independent with
each other. In other words, a node of one RAT needs not to look at and
not to use the capabilities of the other RAT. In case where the
secondary node is NR, gNB can format NR RRC PDUs for the UE
configuration. Nonetheless, this principle does not preclude that the
capabilities of one RAT might contain some information related to the
other RAT, e.g. at least inter-RAT measurement capabilities.</p>
<p>In addition, if the UE supports DC between LTE and NR, the following
principles are additionally taken into account:</p>
<p>1. LTE capability changes;</p>
<p>2. NR capability reporting supports independent capability reporting
in accordance with the principle described in this sub-clause.</p>
<p>3. Capability dependency between LTE and NR.</p>
<p>- Type I capabilities: The use of the capability is isolated to the
RAT.</p>
<p>- Type II capabilities: The use of the capability in one RAT has
impacts to the other RAT but is not understood by the NW side of the
other RAT.</p>
<p>- Type III capabilities: The use of the capability in one RAT has
impacts to the other RAT and is understood by the NW side of the other
RAT.</p>
<p>For Type I capabilities, no coordination between LTE and NR is
required. The secondary RAT specific capabilities are merely forwarded
by the master node to the secondary node, following the baseline DC
within LTE. Some capabilities (e.g. RF capability) are coordinated using
Xx/Xn and involve a reconfiguration of the UE. The configuration of the
UE does not exceed its capabilities. Some capabilities (e.g. buffer
size) are coordinated using Xx/Xn and will not involve a reconfiguration
of the UE. In this case, the ongoing operation of the network does not
exceed the UE capabilities.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: The above type definitions are guidance for the purpose of
discussion in the SI and early part of the WI phase. They will not limit
further discussion and will not be captured in the specifications.</p>
<p>The UE capability coordination between LTE and NR is applied for all
the deployment scenarios described in sub-clause 4.1.2.1, 4.1.2.2 and
4.1.2.3 except for the scenarios of single connectivity. At least, the
following UE capabilities need to be coordinated across the master node
and the secondary node:</p>
<p>- Band combinations across RATs;</p>
<p>- Layer-2 buffer.</p>
<p>For the UE capabilities requiring coordination between LTE and NR,
only two nodes (i.e. one eNB and one gNB) need to be involved.
Nevertheless, the forward compatibility towards multiple node
connectivity can be considered as well. It is up to the master node to
decide on how to resolve the dependency between LTE and NR. The
secondary node can initiate the re-negotiation of the UE capability.
Upon receiving the re-negotiation request from the secondary node, it is
up to the master node to make the final decision.</p>
<h1 id="physical-layer-for-next-generation-radio">8 Physical layer for
next generation radio</h1>
<h2 id="numerologies-and-frame-structure">8.1 Numerologies and frame
structure</h2>
<p>Multiple numerologies are supported. A numerology is defined by
sub-carrier spacing and CP overhead. Multiple subcarrier spacings can be
derived by scaling a basic subcarrier spacing by an integer <em>N</em>.
The numerology used can be selected independently of the frequency band
although it is assumed not to use a very low subcarrier spacing at very
high carrier frequencies. Flexible network and UE channel bandwidth is
supported.</p>
<p>From RAN1 specification perspective, maximum channel bandwidth per NR
carrier is 400MHz in Rel-15. Note that all details for channel bandwidth
at least up to 100 MHz per NR carrier are to be specified in Rel-15. At
least for single numerology case, candidates of the maximum number of
subcarriers per NR carrier is 3300 or 6600 in Rel-15 from RAN1
specification perspective. NR channel designs should consider potential
future extension of these parameters in later releases, allowing Rel-15
UE to have access to NR network on the same frequency band in later
release</p>
<p>A subframe duration is fixed to 1ms and frame length is 10ms.
Scalable numerology should allow at least from 15kHz to 480kHz
subcarrier spacing. All numerologies with 15 kHz and larger subcarrier
spacing, regardless of CP overhead, align on symbol boundaries every 1ms
in NR carrier. More specifically, for the normal CP family, the
following is adopted.</p>
<p>- For subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz * 2<em><sup>n</sup></em>
(<em>n</em> is non-negative integer),</p>
<p>- Each symbol length (including CP) of 15 kHz subcarrier spacing
equals the sum of the corresponding 2<em><sup>n</sup></em> symbols of
the scaled subcarrier spacing.</p>
<p>- Other than the first OFDM symbol in every 0.5ms, all OFDM symbols
within 0.5ms have the same size</p>
<p>- The first OFDM symbol in 0.5ms is longer by
16<em>T</em><sub>s</sub> (assuming 15 kHz and FFT size of 2048) compared
to other OFDM symbols.</p>
<p>- 16 <em>T</em><sub>s</sub> is used for CP for the first symbol.</p>
<p>- For subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz * 2<em><sup>n</sup></em>
(<em>n</em> is a negative integer)</p>
<p>- Each symbol length (including CP) of the subcarrier spacing equals
the sum of the corresponding 2<sup>−<em>n</em></sup> symbols of 15
kHz.</p>
<p>Resource defined by one subcarrier and one symbol is called as
resource element (RE).</p>
<p>The physical layer design supports an extended CP. Extended CP will
be only one in given subcarrier spacing in Rel-15. LTE scaled extended
CP is supported at least for 60 kHz subcarrier spacing in Rel-15. The CP
type can be semi-static configured with UE-specific signaling. UE
supporting the extended CP may depend on UE type/capability.</p>
<p>The number of subcarriers per PRB is 12.</p>
<p>No explicit DC subcarrier is reserved both for downlink and uplink.
Regarding DC present within the transmitter, DC handling of DC
subcarrier in transmitter side is specified as follows:</p>
<p>- Receiver knows where DC subcarrier is or is informed (e.g., by
specification or signaling) of where DC subcarrier is or if DC
subcarrier is not present within receiver bandwidth.</p>
<p>- For the downlink, UE may assume transmitted DC subcarrier at the
transmitter (gNB) side is modulated i.e., data is neither rate-matched
nor punctured.</p>
<p>- Signal quality requirement (e.g., EVM) corresponding to DC
subcarriers is up to RAN4.</p>
<p>- For the uplink, transmitted DC subcarrier at the transmitter (UE)
side is modulated i.e., data is neither rate-matched nor punctured.</p>
<p>- Signal quality requirement (e.g., EVM) corresponding to DC
subcarriers is up to RAN4.</p>
<p>- For the uplink, the transmitter DC subcarrier at the transmitter
(UE) side should avoid collisions at least with DM-RS if possible.</p>
<p>- For the uplink the specification should define at least one
particular subcarrier as the candidate position of DC subcarrier, e.g.,
DC subcarrier is located at the boundary of PRBs</p>
<p>- For the uplink, means for the receiver to determine DC subcarrier
location should be specified.</p>
<p>- This involves semi-static signalling from UE and also standard
specified DC subcarrier location.</p>
<p>- When DC subcarrier is not present, all subcarriers within the
receiver bandwidth are transmitted.</p>
<p>Note that above DC subcarrier can be interpreted as DC subcarrier
candidate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, at the receiver side, no special handling of the
DC subcarrier(s) on the receiver side is specified in RAN1. Behavior is
left to implementation, i.e., the receiver may for example puncture data
received on the DC subcarrier.</p>
<p>A slot is defined as 7 or 14 OFDM symbols for the same subcarrier
spacing of up to 60kHz with normal CP and as 14 OFDM symbols for the
same subcarrier spacing higher than 60kHz with normal CP. A slot can
contain all downlink, all uplink, or {at least one downlink part and at
least one uplink part}. Slot aggregation is supported, i.e., data
transmission can be scheduled to span one or multiple slots.</p>
<p>Mini-slots having the following lengths are defined.</p>
<p>- At least above 6 GHz, mini-slot with length 1 symbol supported.</p>
<p>- Lengths from 2 to slot length -1</p>
<p>- For URLLC, at least 2 is supported</p>
<p>The following should be taken into account for designing slot-level
channels/signals/procedures:</p>
<p>- Possible occurrence of mini-slot/slot transmission(s) occupying
resources scheduled for ongoing slot transmission(s) of a given carrier
for the same/different UEs.</p>
<p>- At least one of DM-RS format/structure/configuration for slot-level
data channel is re-used for mini-slot-level data channel.</p>
<p>- At least one of DL control channel format/structure/configuration
for slot-level data scheduling is designed to be applicable to
mini-slot-level data scheduling.</p>
<p>- At least one of UL control channel format/structure/configuration
for slot-level UCI feedback is designed to be applicable to
mini-slot-level UCI feedback.</p>
<p>Note that some UEs targeting certain use cases may not support all
mini-slot lengths and all starting positions. Mini-slot can start at any
OFDM symbol, at least above 6 GHz. A mini-slot contains DM-RS at
position(s) relative to the start of the mini-slot.</p>
<p>The following targets/use-cases to design mini-slots should be taken
into account.</p>
<p>- Support of very low latency including URLLC for certain slot
lengths</p>
<p>- Target slot lengths are at least 1ms, 0.5ms.</p>
<p>- Support of finer TDM granularity of scheduling for the
same/different UEs within a slot, especially if TRxP uses beam-sweeping
(e.g., above 6GHz).</p>
<p>- NR-LTE co-existence</p>
<p>- Note that this use case also exists for slot-based scheduling</p>
<p>- Forward compatibility towards unlicensed spectrum operation</p>
<p>The following should be taken into account as starting point for
designing mini-slotlevel channels/signals/procedures:</p>
<p>- Possible occurrence of mini-slot/slot transmission(s) occupying
resources scheduled for ongoing slot transmission(s) of a given carrier
for the same/different UEs</p>
<p>- DM-RS for mini-slot-level data channel is just a re-use of that for
slot-level data channel</p>
<p>- DL control channel for mini-slot-level data scheduling is just a
re-use of that for slot-level data scheduling</p>
<p>- UL control channel for mini-slot-level UCI feedback is just a
re-use of that for slot-level UCI feedback</p>
<p>- Scheduling/HARQ timelines for a mini-slot can be based on
scheduling/HARQ timelines for a slot</p>
<p>- Scheduling/HARQ timelines for a mini-slot can be based on

<p>At least for single carrier operation, NR should allow a UE to
operate in a way where it receives at least downlink control information
in a first RF bandwidth and where the UE is not expected to receive
downlink control information or data in a second RF bandwidth that is
larger than the first RF bandwidth within less than <mark>X</mark>

<h4 id="modulation-scheme">8.2.1.1 Modulation scheme</h4>
<p>QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM and 256QAM (with the same constellation mapping as
in LTE) are supported.</p>
<h4 id="physical-layer-channel">8.2.1.2 Physical layer channel </h4>
<p>NR defines physical resource block (PRB) where the number of
subcarriers per PRB is the same for all numerologies. Note that the
number of subcarriers per PRB is 12.</p>
<h5 id="physical-resource-multiplexing">8.2.1.2.1 Physical resource
multiplexing</h5>
<p>Multiplexing different numerologies within a same NR carrier
bandwidth (from the network perspective) is supported in TDM and/or FDM
manner for both downlink and uplink. From UE perspective, multiplexing
different numerologies is performed in TDM and/or FDM manner
within/across (a) subframe duration(s). For subcarrier spacing of <img
src="media/image13.svg" />kHz, subcarriers are mapped on the
subset/superset of those for subcarrier spacing of 15kHz in a nested
manner in the frequency domain and the PRB grids are defined as the
subset/superset of the PRB grid for subcarrier spacing of 15kHz in a
nested manner in the frequency domain.</p>
<p>From network perspective, multiplexing of transmissions with
different latency and/or reliability requirements for eMBB/URLLC in DL
is supported by using the same subcarrier spacing with the same CP
overhead or using different subcarrier spacing. In the specification,
both approaches are to be supported. NR supports dynamic resource
sharing between different latency and/or reliability requirements for
eMBB/URLLC in DL. Dynamic resource sharing between URLLC and eMBB is
supported by transmitting URLLC scheduled traffic where URLLC
transmission may occur in resources scheduled for ongoing eMBB traffic.
DL dynamic resources sharing between eMBB and URLLC is enabled without
pre-emption by scheduling the eMBB and URLLC services on non-overlapping
time/frequency resources (No specific specification work is
expected).</p>
<p>NR supports indication of time and/or frequency region of impacted
eMBB resources to respective eMBB UE(s).</p>
<h5 id="data-channel">8.2.1.2.2 Data channel</h5>
<p>NR supports at least functionality where for DL data scheduled for a
slot, the DL data DM-RS location in time is not dynamically varying
relative to the start of slot.</p>
<h5 id="control-channel">8.2.1.2.3 Control channel</h5>
<p>At least QPSK is supported for the modulation of the NR-PDCCH. For
single stage DCI, modulation scheme for NR-PDCCH is only QPSK. In
frequency-domain, a PRB (or a multiple of PRBs) is the resource unit
size (may or may not including DM-RS) for control channel. A NR-PDCCH
candidate consists of a set of NR-CCEs. A NR-CCE consists of a fixed
number of resource element groups (REGs). A REG is one RB during one
OFDM symbol which may or may not include DM-RS. This is at least for the
case where the DL control region consists of one or a few OFDM symbol(s)
of a slot or a mini-slot. At least for eMBB, in one OFDM symbol,
multiple NR-CCEs cannot be transmitted on the same REG except for
spatial multiplexing to different UEs (MU-MIMO).</p>
<p>At least for single stage DCI design, a UE monitors for downlink
control information in one or more control resource sets where a control
resource set is defined as a set of REGs under a given numerology. The
BW for control resource set is smaller than or equal to the carrier
bandwidth (up to a certain limit). The control resource set is a set of
REGs within which the UE attempts to blindly decode downlink control
information. The REGs may or may not be frequency contiguous. When the
control resource set spans multiple OFDM symbols, a control channel
candidate is mapped to multiple OFDM symbols or to a single OFDM symbol.
The gNB can inform UE which control channel candidates are mapped to
each subset of OFDM symbols in the control resource set. This does not
preclude that UE may receive additional control information elsewhere
within or outside the control resource set in the same or different OFDM
symbol(s). A UE may have one or more control resource sets. NR should
support dynamic reuse of at least part of resources in the control
resource sets for data for the same or a different UE, at least in the
frequency domain. From gNB perspective, DL control channel can be
located at the first OFDM symbol(s) in a slot and/or mini-slot.
UE-specific DL control information monitoring occasions at least in time
domain can be configured. At least for single-stage DCI design, for
slots, minimum granularity of DCI monitoring occasion is once per
slot.</p>
<p>The time/frequency resource containing at least one search space is
obtained from MIB/system information/implicitly derived from initial
access information. Time/frequency resource containing additional search
spaces, can be configured using dedicated RRC signaling. NR-PDCCH can be
mapped contiguously or non-contiguously in frequency. Multiple control
resource sets can be overlapped in frequency and time for a UE. A search
space in NR is associated with a single control resource set. The search
spaces in different control resources sets are defined independently.
Each candidate of NR DL control channel search space is composed by
<em>K</em> NR-CCE(s). Control search space includes at least,
aggregation level(s), number of decoding candidates for each aggregation
level, and the set of CCEs for each decoding candidate. The max number
of blind decoding candidates for a UE is defined independently of the
number of control resource sets and the number of search spaces.</p>
<p>NR supports a group common PDCCH carrying at least slot format
related information. If the UE does not receive the group common PDCCH
the UE should be able to receive at least PDCCH in a slot, at least if
the gNB did not transmit the group common PDCCH. The network will inform
through RRC signalling the UE whether to decode the group common PDCCH
or not. Note that common does not necessarily imply common per cell.
Also, the term group common PDCCH refers to a channel (either a PDCCH or
a separately designed channel) that carries information intended for the
group of UEs. Slot format related information and defined as information
from which the UE can derive at least which symbols in a slot that are
DL, UL (for Rel-15), and other, respectively. The UE will have the
possibility to determine whether some blind decodings can be skipped
based on information on a group common PDCCH (if present). When
monitoring for a PDCCH, the UE should be able to process a detected
PDCCH irrespective of whether the group common PDCCH is received or
not.</p>
<p>UE/NR-PDCCH-specific DM-RS and shared/common RS are supported for
NR-PDCCH reception. At least for beamforming, UE may assume the same
precoding operation for NR-PDCCH and associated DM-RS for NR-PDCCH. The
reference signals in at least one search space do not depend on the RNTI
or UE-identity. In an additional search space, reference signals can be
configured. A UE assumes fixed number of RS REs per REG for control
channel rate matching when the REG contains RS REs. For one UE, the
channel estimate obtained for one RE should be reusable across multiple
blind decodings involving that RE in at least the same control resource
set and type of search space (common or UE-specific).</p>
<p>Transmit diversity is supported for NR-PDCCH.</p>
<p>The starting position of downlink data in a slot can be explicitly
and dynamically indicated to the UE.</p>
<h4 id="waveform">8.2.1.3 Waveform</h4>
<p>OFDM-based waveform is supported. At least up to 40 GHz for eMBB and
URLLC services, CP-OFDM based waveform supports spectral utilization of
Y greater than that of LTE (assuming Y=90% for LTE) where Y (%) is
defined as transmission bandwidth configuration / channel bandwidth *
100%. From RAN1 perspective, spectral confinement technique(s) (e.g.
filtering, windowing, etc.) for a waveform at the transmitter is
transparent to the receiver.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-access-scheme">8.2.1.4 Multiple access scheme</h4>
<p>Synchronous/scheduling-based orthogonal multiple access is at least
supported for DL transmissions, at least targeting for eMBB.</p>
<h4 id="channel-coding">8.2.1.5 Channel coding</h4>
<p>The channel coding scheme for data for eMBB is flexible LDPC as the
single channel coding scheme for all block sizes.</p>
<p>The channel coding scheme for DCI for eMBB is Polar Coding (except
for very small block lengths where repetition/block coding may be
preferred).</p>
<p>Channel coding techniques for NR should support info block size K
flexibility and codeword size flexibility where basic code design with
rate matching (i.e., puncturing and/or repetition) supports 1-bit
granularity in codeword size. Channel coding technique(s) designed for
data channels of NR support both Incremental Redundancy (IR) (or
similar) and Chase Combining (CC) HARQ.</p>
<h5 id="ldpc">8.2.1.5.1 LDPC</h5>
<p>Code extension of a parity-check matrix is used for IR
HARQ/rate-matching support. Lower-triangular extension, which includes
diagonal-extension as a special case, is used. For the QC-LDPC design,
the non-zero sub-blocks have circulant weight = 1. Circulant weight is
the number of superimposed circularly shifted Z×Z identity matrices. In
parity check matrix design, the highest code rate
(<em>R</em><sub>max,<em>j</em></sub> ) to design <em>j</em>-th H matrix
for is <em>R</em><sub>max,<em>j</em></sub> &lt;=8/9, where
<em>R</em><sub>max,<em>j</em></sub> is the code rate of the
<em>j</em>-th H matrix before code extension is applied (0≤
<em>j</em>&lt; <em>J</em>). <em>R</em><sub>max,<em>j</em></sub> is the
code rate after accounting for the built-in puncturing in H matrix
design. Base graph for supporting K<sub>max</sub> has minimum code rate
<em>R</em><sub>min,kmax</sub> of approximately 1/3. Base graph for any
info block sizes <em>K</em> has <em>R</em><sub>min,<em>k</em></sub>
&gt;= ~1/5, provided that <em>N</em><sub>max</sub> is not exceeded. At
least 20Gbps decoder information throughput with code rate 8/9 is
supported.</p>
<p>For a given shift size Z, a QC-LDPC code can be defined by a parity
check matrix which is defined by its base graph and shift values.
Element 1s and 0s in the base graph is replaced by a circulant
permutation matrix of size ZxZ and zero matrix of size ZxZ,
respectively. The shift values of a circulant permutation matrix can be
calculated by a function <em>P<sub>i,j</sub> =
f</em>(<em>V<sub>i,j</sub>, Z</em>) where <em>V<sub>i,j</sub></em><img
src="media/image14.png" /> is an integer corresponding to the <img
src="media/image15.png" />(<em>i,j</em>)-th non-zero element in a base
matrix. The shift value <em>P<sub>i,j</sub></em> is circularly shifted
value from the identity matrix for the (<em>i,j</em>)<img
src="media/image16.png" />-th non-zero element in a base matrix. The
<img src="media/image17.png" /> ZxZ circulant permutation matrix which
shifts the <img src="media/image17.png" /> ZxZ identity matrix <img
src="media/image18.png" /><em>I</em> to the right by
<em>P<sub>i,j</sub></em> <img src="media/image19.png" /> times for the
(<em>i,j</em>)<img src="media/image15.png" />-th non-zero element in a
base matrix.</p>
<p>Shortening is applied before LDPC encoding when necessary. Built-in
puncturing of systematic bits is supported for LDPC coding, i.e., at
least for the initial transmission, the coded bits are taken after
skipping the first <em>N</em><sub>sys,punct</sub> systematic bits.</p>
<p>For at least one base graph, the base matrix consists of five
sub-matrices (A, B, C, D, E) as shown in Fig. 8.2.1.5.1-1. A corresponds
to systematic bits. B is square and corresponds to parity bits. The
first or last column may be weight 1. The non-zero value is in the last
row and this row is weight 1 in B. If there is a weight 1 column, then
the remaining columns contain a square matrix such that the first column
has weight three. The columns after the weight three column have a dual
diagonal structure (i.e., main diagonal and off diagonal). If there is
no weight 1 column, B consists of only a square matrix such that the
first column has weight three. The columns after the weight three column
have a dual diagonal structure (i.e., main diagonal and off diagonal). C
is a zero matrix. E is an identity matrix for the above base graph.
These examples are shown in Fig. 8.2.1.5.1-2.</p>

<p>The rate matching for LDPC code is circular buffer based (same
concept as in LTE). The circular buffer is filled with an ordered
sequence of systematic bits and parity bits. For IR-HARQ, each
Redundancy Version (RV), <em>RV<sub>i</sub></em>, is assigned a starting
bit location <em>S<sub>i</sub></em> on the circular buffer. For IR
retransmission of <em>RV<sub>i</sub></em>, the coded bits are read out
sequentially from the circular buffer, starting with the bit location
<em>S<sub>i</sub></em>. Limited buffer rate matching (LBRM) is
supported</p>
<p>Before code block segmentation, <em>L</em><sub>TB,CRC</sub> bit
TB-level CRC are attached to the end of the transport block, where
<em>L</em><sub>TB,CRC</sub> &lt;=24 bits, <em>L</em><sub>TB,CRC</sub>

<h5 id="beam-management">8.2.1.6.1 Beam management</h5>
<p>In NR, beam management is defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>- Beam management:</strong> a set of L1/L2 procedures to
acquire and maintain a set of TRxP(s) and/or UE beams that can be used
for DL and UL transmission/reception, which include at least following
aspects:</p>
<p><strong>- Beam determination:</strong> for TRxP(s) or UE to select of
its own Tx/Rx beam(s).</p>
<p><strong>- Beam measurement:</strong> for TRxP(s) or UE to measure
characteristics of received beamformed signals</p>
<p><strong>- Beam reporting:</strong> for UE to report information of
beamformed signal(s) based on beam measurement</p>
<p><strong>- Beam sweeping:</strong> operation of covering a spatial
area, with beams transmitted and/or received during a time interval in a
predetermined way.</p>
<p>Also, the followings are defined as Tx/Rx beam correspondence at TRxP
and UE:</p>
<p>- Tx/Rx beam correspondence at TRxP holds if at least one of the
following is satisfied:</p>
<p>- TRxP is able to determine a TRxP Rx beam for the uplink reception
based on UE’s downlink measurement on TRxP’s one or more Tx beams.</p>
<p>- TRxP is able to determine a TRxP Tx beam for the downlink
transmission based on TRxP’s uplink measurement on TRxP’s one or more Rx
beams</p>
<p>- Tx/Rx beam correspondence at UE holds if at least one of the
following is satisfied:</p>
<p>- UE is able to determine a UE Tx beam for the uplink transmission
based on UE’s downlink measurement on UE’s one or more Rx beams.</p>
<p>- UE is able to determine a UE Rx beam for the downlink reception
based on TRxP’s indication based on uplink measurement on UE’s one or
more Tx beams.</p>
<p>- Capability indication of UE beam correspondence related information
to TRxP is supported.</p>
<p>Note that definition/terminology of Tx/Rx beam correspondence is for
convenience of discussion. The detailed performance conditions are up to
RAN4.</p>
<p>The following DL L1/L2 beam management procedures are supported
within one or multiple TRxPs:</p>
<p>- P-1: is used to enable UE measurement on different TRxP Tx beams to
support selection of TRxP Tx beams/UE Rx beam(s)</p>
<p>- For beamforming at TRxP, it typically includes a intra/inter-TRxP
Tx beam sweep from a set of different beams. For beamforming at UE, it
typically includes a UE Rx beam sweep from a set of different beams.</p>
<p>- P-2: is used to enable UE measurement on different TRxP Tx beams to
possibly change inter/intra-TRxP Tx beam(s)</p>
<p>- From a possibly smaller set of beams for beam refinement than in
P-1. Note that P-2 can be a special case of P-1.</p>
<p>- P-3: is used to enable UE measurement on the same TRxP Tx beam to
change UE Rx beam in the case UE uses beamforming</p>
<p>At least network triggered aperiodic beam reporting is supported
under P-1, P-2, and P-3 related operations.</p>
<p>UE measurement based on RS for beam management (at least CSI-RS) is
composed of <em>K</em> (= total number of configured beams) beams, and
UE reports measurement results of <em>N</em> selected Tx beams, where
<em>N</em> is not necessarily fixed number. Note that the procedure
based on RS for mobility purpose is not precluded. Reporting information
at least include measurement quantities for <em>N</em> beam (s) and
information indicating <em>N</em> DL Tx beam(s), if <em>N</em> &lt;
<em>K</em>. Specifically, when a UE is configured with <em>K’</em> &gt;1
non-zero power (NZP) CSI-RS resources, a UE can report <em>N’</em> CRIs
(CSI-RS Resource Indicator).</p>
<p>A UE can be configured with the following high layer parameters for
beam management:</p>
<p>- N≥1 reporting settings, M≥1 resource settings</p>
<p>- The links between reporting settings and resource settings are
configured in the agreed CSI measurement setting</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- CSI-RS based P-1 &amp; P-2 are supported with resource and
reporting settings</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- P-3 can be supported with or without reporting setting</p>
<p>- A reporting setting at least including</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Information indicating selected beam(s)</p>
<p>- L1 measurement reporting</p>
<p>- Time-domain behavior: e.g. aperiodic, periodic, semi-persistent</p>
<p>- Frequency-granularity if multiple frequency granularities are
supported</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- A resource setting at least including</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Time-domain behavior: e.g. aperiodic, periodic, semi-persistent</p>
<p>- RS type: NZP CSI-RS at least</p>
<p>- At least one CSI-RS resource set, with each CSI-RS resource set
having K≥1 CSI-RS resources</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- Some parameters of <em>K</em> CSI-RS resources can be the same,
e.g. port number, time-domain behavior, density and periodicity if
any</p>
<p>At least one of these two alternatives of beam reporting is
supported.</p>
<p>- Alt 1:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- UE reports information about TRxP Tx Beam(s) that can be received
using selected UE Rx beam set(s) where a Rx beam set refers to a set of
UE Rx beams that are used for receiving a DL signal. Note that it is UE
implementation issues on how to construct the Rx beam set. One example
is that each of Rx beam in a UE Rx beam set corresponds to a selected Rx
beam in each panel. For UEs with more than one UE Rx beam sets, the UE
can report TRxP Tx Beam(s) and an identifier of the associated UE Rx
beam set per reported TX beam(s).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- NOTE: Different TRxP Tx beams reported for the same Rx beam set can
be received simultaneously at the UE.</p>
<p>- NOTE: Different TRxP TX beams reported for different UE Rx beam set
may not be possible to be received simultaneously at the UE</p>
<p>- Alt 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- UE reports information about TRxP Tx Beam(s) per UE antenna group
basis where UE antenna group refers to receive UE antenna panel or
subarray. For UEs with more than one UE antenna group, the UE can report
TRxP Tx Beam(s) and an identifier of the associated UE antenna group per
reported TX beam.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- NOTE: Different TX beams reported for different antenna groups can
be received simultaneously at the UE.</p>
<p>- NOTE: Different TX beams reported for the same UE antenna group may
not be possible to be received simultaneously at the UE</p>
<p>NR also supports the following beam reporting considering <em>L</em>
groups where <em>L</em>&gt;=1 and each group refers to a Rx beam set
(Alt1) or a UE antenna group (Alt2) depending on which alternative is
adopted. For each group <em>l</em>, UE reports at least the following
information:</p>
<p>- Information indicating group at least for some cases</p>
<p>- Measurement quantities for <em>N<sub>l</sub></em> beam (s)</p>
<p>- Support L1 RSRP and CSI report (when CSI-RS is for CSI
acquisition)</p>
<p>- Information indicating <em>N<sub>l</sub></em> DL Tx beam(s) when
applicable</p>
<p>This group based beam reporting is configurable per UE basis. This
group based beam reporting can be turned off per UE basis e.g., when
<em>L</em>=1 or <em>N<sub>l</sub></em>=1. Note that no group identifier
is reported when it is turned off.</p>
<p>NR supports that UE can trigger mechanism to recover from beam
failure. Beam failure event occurs when the quality of beam pair link(s)
of an associated control channel falls low enough (e.g. comparison with
a threshold, time-out of an associated timer). Mechanism to recover from
beam failure is triggered when beam failure occurs. Note that here the
beam pair link is used for convenience, and may or may not be used in
specification. Network explicitly configures to UE with resources for UL
transmission of signals for recovery purpose. Configurations of
resources are supported where the base station is listening from all or
partial directions, e.g., random access region. The UL
transmission/resources to report beam failure can be located in the same
time instance as PRACH (resources orthogonal to PRACH resources) or at a
time instance (configurable for a UE) different from PRACH. Transmission
of DL signal is supported for allowing the UE to monitor the beams for
identifying new potential beams.</p>
<p>NR supports beam management with and without beam-related indication.
When beam-related indication is provided, information pertaining to
UE-side beamforming/receiving procedure used for CSI-RS-based
measurement can be indicated through QCL to UE. NR supports using the
same or different beams on control channel and the corresponding data
channel transmissions.</p>
<p>For NR-PDCCH transmission supporting robustness against beam pair
link blocking, UE can be configured to monitor NR-PDCCH on <em>M</em>
beam pair links simultaneously, where M≥1 and the maximum value of
<em>M</em> may depend at least on UE capability. UE can be configured to
monitor NR-PDCCH on different beam pair link(s) in different NR-PDCCH
OFDM symbols. Parameters related to UE Rx beam setting for monitoring
NR-PDCCH on multiple beam pair links are configured by higher layer
signaling or MAC CE and/or considered in the search space design. At
least, NR supports indication of spatial QCL assumption between an DL RS
antenna port(s), and DL RS antenna port(s) for demodulation of DL
control channel. Candidate signaling methods for beam indication for a
NR-PDCCH (i.e. configuration method to monitor NR-PDCCH) are MAC CE
signaling, RRC signaling, DCI signaling, specification-transparent
and/or implicit method, and combination of these signaling methods. Note
that indication may not be needed for some cases.</p>
<p>For reception of unicast DL data channel, NR supports indication of
spatial QCL assumption between DL RS antenna port(s) and DM-RS antenna
port(s) of DL data channel. Information indicating the RS antenna
port(s) is indicated via DCI (downlink grants). The information
indicates the RS antenna port(s) which is QCL-ed with DM-RS antenna
port(s). Different set of DM-RS antenna port(s) for the DL data channel
can be indicated as QCL with different set of RS antenna port(s). Note
that indication may not be needed for some cases.</p>
<h5 id="mimo-schemes">8.2.1.6.2 MIMO schemes</h5>

the following DM-RS based DL MIMO transmissions are supported for data
in NR.</p>
<p>- Scheme 1: Closed-loop transmission where data and DM-RS are
transmitted with the same precoding matrix</p>
<p>- Demodulation of data at the UE does not require knowledge of the
precoding matrix used at the transmitter</p>
<p>- Note: spatial multiplexing and rank-1 are included</p>
<p>- Scheme 2: Open loop and Semi-open loop transmissions where data and
DM-RS may or may not be restricted to be transmitted with the same
precoding matrix</p>
<p>- Demodulation of data at the UE may or may not require knowledge of
the relation between DM-RS ports and data layers</p>
<p>- Note: DM-RS can be precoded or not precoded</p>
<p>For the downlink data, at least a Precoding Resource block Group
(PRG) size for PRB bundling equal to a specified value is supported.
Configurable PRG size is also supported for data DM-RS.</p>
<p>Dynamic switching between transmission methods/schemes is supported.
The following two sets of transmission parameters are at least
supported.</p>
<p>- Transmission parameter set 1: parameters configured</p>
<p>- For default transmission scheme, specify default values of
parameters in the Transmission parameter set 1</p>
<p>- Note that depending on parameter settings in transmission parameter
set 1, the size of transmission parameter set 2, i.e. DCI size, may
vary.</p>
<p>- Transmission parameter set 2: parameters indicated by physical
layer (e.g. NR PDCCH channel)</p>
<p>- Note: some transmission parameter may belong to both set-1 and

<p>Downlink transmission scheme(s) achieving diversity gain at least for

<p>For Type I and II, CSI feedback per subband as well as partial band

feedback can be also included. For CSI reporting for a component
carrier, at least three different frequency granularities are

<p>- Wideband CSI</p>
<p>- Wideband size is determined by UE RF capability of receiving DL

example, wideband CSI is used for analog beam management at least.</p>
<p>- Partial band CSI</p>

<p>- Aperiodic CSI reporting is triggered by DCI</p>
<p>- Aperiodic CSI-RS is triggered by DCI and/or MAC CE</p>
<p>Note that it is possible to dynamically trigger RS and reports
through links in the measurement setting. To support combinations above
more flexibly, NR should allow independent control of CSI-RS indication
and CSI reporting indication timings. The indication may refer to
triggering, activation, and deactivation depending on type of
RS/reporting. Also, NR supports mechanism(s) to trigger aperiodic CSI-RS
and aperiodic CSI reporting simultaneously. For aperiodic CSI-RS timing
offset <em>X</em>, support <em>X</em>=0 at least, if aperiodic CSI-RS
triggering is done by DCI. Note that aperiodic CSI-RS timing offset X
refers to the time gap between aperiodic CSI-RS triggering and aperiodic
CSI-RS transmission with regard to the number of slots. For CSI
reporting timing offset <em>Y</em> that is fixed or configurable by the
network but with certain restriction on lower limit of <em>Y</em> to
provide sufficient CSI computation time. Note that aperiodic CSI
reporting timing offset Y refers to the time gap between aperiodic CSI
reporting triggering and aperiodic CSI reporting with regard to the
number of slots.</p>

<p>- CSI reporting band is defined as a collection of (contiguous or
non-contiguous) subbands pertinent to a CSI reporting setting. Three
frequency granularities are supported, i.e., wideband reporting, partial

least 32 ports. UE is configured by RRC signaling with one or more
CSI-RS resource sets and CSI-RS resources is dynamically allocated from
the one or more sets to one or more users. Allocation can be aperiodic

<p>- Across (sub)time units, same CSI-RS antenna ports can be mapped</p>
<p>- Each time unit can be partitioned into sub-time units</p>
<p>- Mapping structure can be used for supporting multiple panels/Tx
chains</p>
<p>For beam management overhead and latency reduction, NR also considers
beam sweeping for CSI-RS within an OFDM symbol. Note that the symbol
duration is based on a reference numerology.</p>
<p>NZP CSI-RS resource is defined in NR, as a set of NZP CSI-RS port(s)
mapped to a set of REs within a frequency span/a time duration which can

that, depending on the density reduction approach, the <em>Y</em> REs of
a component CSI-RS RE pattern may be non-adjacent in the frequency

<p>Definition of QCL is that two antenna ports are said to be quasi
co-located if properties of the channel over which a symbol on one

<p>- Not all ports are quasi-collocated.</p>
<p>DM-RS ports grouping is supported, and DM-RS ports within one group

For coordinated transmission schemes for NR, different types of
coordinated transmission schemes for NR are supported. Both semi-static

<h4 id="scheduling">8.2.2.1 Scheduling</h4>
<p>NR supports both data and control with the same numerology. NR

is indicated by a field in the DCI from a set of values and the set of
values is configured by higher layer. The timing(s) is (are) defined at
least for the case where the timing(s) is (are) unknown to the UE. Both
contiguous and non-contiguous resource allocation for data with CP-OFDM
is supported. Resource allocation for data transmission for a UE not
capable of supporting the carrier bandwidth can be derived based on a
two-step frequency-domain assignment process, i.e., indication of a
bandwidth part (the 1<sup>st</sup> step) and indication of the PRBs
within the bandwidth part (2<sup>nd</sup> step).</p>
<p>Indication of URLLC transmission overlapping the resources scheduled
for an eMBB UE in downlink can be dynamically signaled to the eMBB UE to
facilitate demodulation and decoding. Indication can be dynamically
signaled to a UE, whose assigned downlink resources have partially been
preempted by another downlink transmission, to increase the likelihood
of successful demodulation and decoding of the TB(s) transmitted within
the above mentioned assigned resource. The indication may be used to
increase the likelihood of successful demodulation and decoding of the
transport block based on the pre-empted transmission and/or subsequent
(re)-transmissions of the same TB.</p>
<h4 id="harq">8.2.2.2 HARQ</h4>
<p>HARQ-ACK feedback with one bit per TB is supported. Operation of more
than one DL HARQ processes is supported for a given UE while operation
of one DL HARQ process is supported for some UEs. UE supports a set of
minimum HARQ processing time. NR also supports different minimum HARQ
processing time at least for across UEs. The HARQ processing time at
least includes delay between DL data reception timing to the
corresponding HARQ-ACK transmission timing and delay between UL grant
reception timing to the corresponding UL data transmission timing. UE is
required to indicate its capability of minimum HARQ processing time to
gNB.</p>
<p>Asynchronous and adaptive DL HARQ is supported at least for eMBB and
URLLC. From UE perspective, HARQ ACK/NACK feedback for multiple DL
transmissions in time can be transmitted in one UL data/control region.

<h5
id="synchronization-signal-and-dl-broadcast-signalchannel-structure">8.2.2.3.1
Synchronization signal and DL broadcast signal/channel structure</h5>
<p>NR synchronization signal is based on CP-OFDM. NR defines at least
two types of synchronization signals; NR-PSS and NR-SSS. NR-PSS is
defined at least for initial symbol boundary synchronization to the NR
cell. NR-SSS is defined for detection of NR cell ID or at least part of
NR cell ID. The number of NR cell IDs is targeted to be approximately
1000. NR-SSS detection is based on the fixed time/frequency relationship
with NR-PSS resource position irrespective of duplex mode and beam
operation type at least within a given frequency range and CP overhead.
At least, normal CP is supported for NR-PSS/SSS.</p>
<p>The raster for NR synchronization signals can be different per
frequency range. At least for frequency ranges where NR supports a wider
carrier bandwidth and operation in a wider frequency spectrum (e.g.
above 6 GHz), the NR synchronization signals raster can be larger than
the 100 kHz raster of LTE. When the synchronization signal bandwidth is
the same as the minimum system bandwidth for a given frequency band
which UE searches, synchronization signal frequency raster is the same
as the channel raster. For carrier supporting initial access, for
frequency range up to 6 GHz, minimum carrier bandwidth for NR can be
either 5 or 10 MHz and is frequency band dependent. For frequency range
from 6 GHz to 52.6 GHz, minimum carrier bandwidth for NR can be either
40 or 80 MHz and is frequency band dependent.</p>
<p>At least one broadcast channel (NR-PBCH) is defined. NR-PBCH decoding
is based on the fixed relationship with NR-PSS and/or NR-SSS resource
position irrespective of duplex mode and beam operation type at least
within a given frequency range and CP overhead. NR-PBCH is a
non-scheduled broadcast channel carrying at least a part of minimum
system information with fixed payload size and periodicity predefined in
the specification depending on carrier frequency range.</p>
<p>In both single beam and multi-beam scenario, time division
multiplexing of NR-PSS, NR-SSS, and NR-PBCH is supported. NR-PSS, NR-SSS
and/or NR-PBCH can be transmitted within an SS block. For a given
frequency band, an SS block corresponds to <em>N</em> OFDM symbols based
on the default subcarrier spacing, and <em>N</em> is a constant. The
signal multiplexing structure is fixed in a specification. UE shall be
able to identify at least OFDM symbol index, slot index in a radio frame
and radio frame number from an SS block.</p>
<p>One or multiple SS block(s) compose an SS burst. One or multiple SS
burst(s) further compose an SS burst set where the number of SS bursts
within a SS burst set is finite. From physical layer specification
perspective, at least one periodicity of SS burst set is supported. From
UE perspective, SS burst set transmission is periodic and UE may assume
that a given SS block is repeated with a SS burst set periodicity. Note
that NR-PBCH contents in a given repeated SS block may change. A single
set of possible SS block time locations is specified per frequency band.
The maximum number of SS-blocks within SS burst set may be carrier
frequency dependent. The position(s) of actual transmitted SS-blocks can
be informed for helping CONNECTED/IDLE mode measurement, for helping
CONNECTED mode UE to receive DL data/control in unused SS-blocks and
potentially for helping IDLE mode UE to receive DL data/control in
unused SS-blocks. By default, the UE may neither assume the gNB
transmits the same number of physical beam(s), nor the same physical
beam(s) across different SS-blocks within an SS burst set. For initial
cell selection, UE may assume default SS burst set periodicity which may
be frequency band-dependent. At least for multi-beams case, at least the
time index of SS-block is indicated to the UE.</p>
<p>For CONNECTED and IDLE mode UEs, NR supports network indication of SS
burst set periodicity and information to derive measurement
timing/duration (e.g., time window for NR-SS detection). The network
provides one SS burst set periodicity information per frequency carrier
to UE and information to derive measurement timing/duration if possible.
In case that one SS burst set periodicity and one information regarding
timing/duration are indicated, UE assumes the periodicity and
timing/duration for all cells on the same carrier. If the network does
not provide indication of SS burst set periodicity and information to
derive measurement timing/duration the UE should assume 5 ms as the SS
burst set periodicity. NR supports set of SS burst set periodicity
values for adaptation and network indication.</p>
<p>For initial access, UE can assume a signal corresponding to a
specific subcarrier spacing of NR-PSS/SSS in a given frequency band
given by specification.</p>
<p>For NR-PSS, ZC-sequence can be used as the baseline sequence for
NR-PSS for study. At least one basic sequence length is defined for each
synchronization signal in case of sequence-based synchronization signal
design. The number of antenna port of NR-PSS is 1.</p>
<p>For NR-PBCH transmission, a single fixed number of antenna port(s) is
supported. No blind detection of NR-PBCH transmission scheme or number
of antenna ports is required by the UE. UE assumes the same PBCH
numerology as that of NR-SS. For the minimum system information
delivery, part of minimum system information is transmitted in NR-PBCH.
NR-PBCH contents shall include at least part of the SFN (system frame
number), and CRC. The remaining minimum system information is
transmitted in shared downlink channel via NR-PDSCH.</p>
<h5 id="mobility">8.2.2.3.2 Mobility</h5>
<p>For RRM measurement in NR, DL measurement is supported with the
consideration on both single-beam based operation and multi-beam based
operation. NR supports cell-level mobility based on DL cell-level
measurement (e.g. RSRP for each cell) in IDLE mode UE. Note that IDLE
mode refers to a UE state similar to LTE IDLE state, whose exact
definition is up to RAN2 and CONNECTED mode refers to a UE state similar
to LTE CONNECTED state, whose exact definition is up to RAN2. Also, note
that cell refers to NR cell which is tied to a same ID carried by NR-SS.
At least NR-SSS is used for DL based RRM measurement for L3 mobility in
IDLE mode. For CONNECTED mode RRM measurement for L3 mobility, CSI-RS
can be used, in addition to IDLE mode RS. Detection of neighbor cell for
measurement is based on NR-SS.</p>
<p>Adaptation and network indication of the valid time and frequency
resources are supported which may be used for inter-/intra-frequency RRM
measurements and reports for ‘CONNECTED’ mode UEs.</p>
<p>RSRP(s) can be measured from the IDLE mode RS. One RSRP value is
measured from the IDLE mode RS per SS block. The measured values are
referred to “SS-block-RSRP”. It is RAN1’s understanding that
“SS-block-RSRP” may correspond to the “beam quality” in RAN2 agreements
in multi-beam case, at least in IDLE mode.</p>
<p>At least one of cell-level and beam-level measurement quantities is
supported for RRM reporting.</p>
<h5 id="paging">8.2.2.3.3 Paging</h5>
<p>For paging in multi-beam operation, beam sweeping is supported for

<p>Physical uplink control signaling should be able to carry at least
hybrid-ARQ acknowledgements, CSI reports (possibly including beamforming
information), and scheduling requests.</p>
<p>At least two ways of transmissions are supported for NR UL control
channel</p>
<p>- UL control channel can be transmitted in short duration around the
last transmitted UL symbol(s) of a slot. UL control channel is
time-division-multiplexed and/or frequency-division-multiplexed with UL
data channel within a slot. For UL control channel in short duration,
transmission over one symbol duration of a slot is supported.</p>
<p>- Short UCI and data are frequency-division-multiplexed both within a
UE and between UEs, at least for the case where the PRBs for short UCI
and data are non-overlapping.</p>
<p>- In order to support TDM of short PUCCH from different UEs in the
same slot, a mechanism to tell the UE in which symbol(s) in a slot to
transmit the short PUCCH on is supported at least above 6 GHz.</p>
<p>- At least following is supported for PUCCH in 1-symbol duration:</p>
<p>- UCI and RS are multiplexed in the given OFDM symbol in FDM manner
if RS is multiplexed.</p>
<p>- Same subcarrier spacing between DL/UL data and PUCCH in
short-duration in the same slot.</p>
<p>- At least a PUCCH in short-duration spanning 2-symbol duration of a
slot is supported.</p>
<p>- Same subcarrier spacing between DL/UL data and PUCCH in
short-duration in the same slot.</p>
<p>- At least semi-static configuration for the following is
supported.</p>
<p>- A PUCCH resource of a given UE within a slot. i.e., short-PUCCHs of
different UEs can be time-division multiplexed within the given duration
in a slot.</p>
<p>- The PUCCH resource includes time, frequency and, when applicable,
code domains.</p>
<p>- PUCCH in short-duration can span until the end of a slot from UE
perspective</p>
<p>- No explicit gap symbol is necessary after the PUCCH in
short-duration.</p>
<p>- For a slot having short UL-part (i.e., DL-centric slot):</p>
<p>- ‘Short UCI’ and data can be frequency-division multiplexed by one
UE if a data is scheduled on the short UL-part.</p>
<p>UL control channel can be transmitted in long duration over multiple
UL symbols to improve coverage. UL control channel is
frequency-division-multiplexed with UL data channel within a slot.</p>
<p>- A UCI carried by long duration UL control channel at least with low
PAPR design can be transmitted in one slot or multiple slots.</p>
<p>- Transmission across multiple slots should allow a total duration,
e.g., 1ms, at least for some cases.</p>
<p>- For UL control channel with long duration, TDM between RS and UCI
is supported at least for DFT-S-OFDM.</p>
<p>- Long UL-part of a slot can be used for transmission of PUCCH in
long-duration, i.e., PUCCH in long-duration is supported for both
UL-only slot and a slot with variable number of symbols with a minimum
of 4 symbols for PUCCH transmission..</p>
<p>- At least for 1 or 2 UCI bits, the UCI can be repeated within N
slots (N&gt;1) where the <em>N</em> slots may or may not be adjacent in
slots where PUCCH in long duration is allowed.</p>
<p>- Simultaneous transmission of PUSCH and PUCCH at least for the long
PUCCH format is supported, i.e., transmit uplink control on PUCCH
resources even in presence of data. In addition to simultaneous
PUCCH-PUSCH transmission, UCI on PUSCH is supported.</p>
<p>- Intra-TTI slot frequency-hopping is supported.</p>
<p>- DFT-s-OFDM waveform is supported.</p>
<p>- Transmit antenna diversity is supported.</p>
<p>Both TDM and FDM between short duration PUCCH and long duration PUCCH
are supported at least for different UEs in one slot. In
frequency-domain, a PRB (or multiple PRBs) is the minimum resource unit
size for UL control channel. The frequency resource and hopping, if
hopping is used, may not spread over the carrier bandwidth. UE-specific
RS is used for NR-PUCCH transmission. A set of PUCCH resources is
configured by high layer signaling and a PUCCH resource within the
configured set is indicated by DCI.</p>
<p>It should be possible to dynamically indicate (at least in
combination with RRC) the timing between data reception and hybrid-ARQ
acknowledgement transmission as part of the DCI. A combination of
semi-static configuration and (at least for some types of UCI
information) dynamic signaling is used to determine the PUCCH resource
both for the ‘long and short PUCCH formats’, where the PUCCH resource
includes time, frequency and, when applicable, code domains. UCI on
PUSCH, i.e., using some of the scheduled resources for UCI is supported
in case of simultaneous UCI and data.</p>
<p>At least UL transmission of at least single HARQ-ACK bit is
supported.</p>
<p>Mechanism enabling frequency-diversity is supported.</p>
<p>For URLLC, time interval between SR resources configured for a UE can
be smaller than a slot.</p>
<h4 id="waveform-1">8.3.1.3 Waveform</h4>
<p>OFDM-based waveform is supported. At least up to 40 GHz for eMBB and
URLLC services, CP-OFDM based waveform supports spectral utilization of
Y greater than that of LTE (assuming Y=90% for LTE) where Y (%) is
defined as transmission bandwidth configuration / channel bandwidth *
100%. From RAN1 perspective, spectral confinement technique(s) (e.g.
filtering, windowing, etc.) for a waveform at the transmitter is
transparent to the receiver.</p>
<p>DFT-S-OFDM based waveform is also supported, complementary to CP-OFDM
waveform at least for eMBB uplink for up to 40GHz. CP-OFDM waveform can
be used for a single-stream and multi-stream (i.e. MIMO) transmissions,
while DFT-S-OFDM based waveform is limited to a single stream
transmissions (targeting for link budget limited cases). Network can
decide and communicate to the UE which one of CP-OFDM and DFT-S-OFDM
based waveforms to use Note that both CP-OFDM and DFT-S-OFDM based
waveforms are mandatory for UEs.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-access-scheme-1">8.3.1.4 Multiple access scheme</h4>
<p>Synchronous/scheduling-based orthogonal multiple access is at least
supported for UL transmissions, at least targeting for eMBB. Note that
synchronous means that timing offset between UEs is within cyclic prefix
by e.g. timing alignment.</p>
<p>NR targets to support UL non-orthogonal multiple access, in addition
to the orthogonal approach, targeting at least for mMTC.</p>
<h4 id="channel-coding-1">8.3.1.5 Channel coding</h4>
<p>The channel coding scheme for data for eMBB is flexible LDPC as the
single channel coding scheme for all block sizes.</p>
<p>The channel coding scheme for UL control information for eMBB is

and CSI acquisition</h5>
<p>For UL CSI acquisition, UE can be configured with multiple SRS
resources, where UE can be configured to transmit SRS in each configured
SRS resource. In NR, UE reports its capability regarding the max number

<p>- For DFT-S-OFDM, CDD, precoder cycling, antenna port switching,
SFBC, and STBC can be the candidates for UL diversity schemes for UL
data</p>
<p>Dynamic switching between transmission methods/schemes is supported.
Rank determination is performed by gNB. PRB bundling is supported for
CP-OFDM and for DFT-s-OFDM based transmission. For CP-OFDM based
transmission, PRB bundling is supported for both codebook based and
non-codebook based transmissions. For DFT-S-OFDM based transmission, PRB
bundling size is the whole scheduled bandwidth if the scheduled
bandwidth comprises a single cluster. Note that UE shall apply the
precoder in a way that the gNB may assume that UE uses the same precoder
for all scheduled PRBs.</p>
<p>UL DM-RS based spatial multiplexing (SU-MIMO/MU-MIMO) is supported.
At least a maximum of 4 layers uplink SU-MIMO transmission is
supported.</p>
<p>At least one of precoded and non-precoded SRS based UL link

<p>- SRS: Reference signal with main functionalities of CSI acquisition,
beam management</p>
<p>- DM-RS: Reference signal with main functionalities of data and
control demodulation</p>
<p>- Reference signal for phase tracking</p>
<h6 id="srs">8.3.1.6.3.1 SRS</h6>
<p>NR SRS design should not assume a particular antenna configuration at
UE and should support dynamic port/antenna/resource selection by gNB and
UE. In the case of UE selection, it can be disabled/enabled by gNB (if
the UE selection is not transparent).</p>
<p>NR UL supports transmissions of SRS precoded with same and different
UE Tx beams within a time duration. NR supports the following Tx
beamformer determination for SRS.</p>
<p>- UE applies gNB-transparent Tx beamformer to SRS, e.g., UE
determines Tx beam for each SRS port/resource</p>
<p>- Based on gNB indication, e.g. via SRI</p>
<p>NR supports SRS transmission including number of SRS ports are 1, 2,
and 4 at least, Comb levels of 2 and 4, and configurable frequency
hopping.</p>
<p>Configurable SRS bandwidth is supported. SRS can be configurable with
regard to density in frequency domain (e.g., comb levels) and/or in time
domain (including multi-symbol SRS transmissions). Partial band size and
full band size can be configured. Partial-band is smaller than the
largest transmission bandwidth supported by the UE. Within a
partial-band, the PRBs for SRS transmission can at least be consecutive
in the frequency domain. Frequency hopping is supported within a
partial-band for a UE where at least hopping with a granularity of
subband is supported. For the full band size, the size is equal to the
largest transmission bandwidth supported by the UE. The numerology(ies)
for the SRS transmissions can be also configurable for a UE.</p>
<p>An NR-SRS resource comprises of a set of resource elements (RE)
within a time duration/frequency span and <em>N</em> antenna ports
(<em>N</em> ≥ 1). A UE can be configured with <em>K</em> ≥ 1 NR-SRS
resources. The maximum value of <em>K</em> is considered to be a UE
capability to avoid mandatory support for large values of <em>K</em>.
Out of K ≥ 1 configured NR-SRS resources, for aperiodic transmission,
the UE can be configured to transmit a subset of or all K NR-SRS
resources with no precoding, the same, or different precoding. For
periodic and semi-persistent transmission, out of K ≥ 1 configured
NR-SRS resources, the UE can be configured to transmit <em>K</em> NR-SRS
resources with no precoding, the same, or different precoding.</p>
<p>SRS transmissions with sequences achieving low-PAPR and possible
multiplexing of SRS with different SRS bandwidths in the same symbol are
considered.</p>
<p>Aperiodic SRS transmission triggered by the network is supported.
Periodic and semi-persistent NR-SRS transmissions are also
supported.</p>
<h6 id="pt-rs">8.3.1.6.3.2 PT-RS</h6>
<p>For CP-OFDM, time-domain density mapped on every other symbol and/or
every symbol and/or every 4-th symbol is supported. At least for UL, the
presence of PT-RS is UE-specifically configured .PT-RS is confined in
the scheduled time/frequency duration for a UE. For a given UE, the
designated PT-RS is confined in scheduled resource as a baseline.
Presence/patterns of PT-RS in scheduled resource are UE-specifically
configured by a combination of RRC signaling and association with
parameter(s) used for other purposes (e.g., MCS) which are (dynamically)
indicated by DCI. Whether PT-RS can be present or not depends on RRC
configuration. When configured, the dynamic presence is associated with
DCI parameter(s) including at least MCS.. Multiple PT-RS densities
defined in time/frequency domain are supported. When present, frequency
domain density is associated with at least dynamic configuration of the
scheduled BW. UE can assume the same precoding for a DM-RS port and a
PT-RS port. Number of PT-RS ports can be fewer than number of DM-RS
ports in scheduled resource.</p>
<p>In NR, frequency offset and PN compensation for DFT-s-OFDM are also
considered.</p>
<h3 id="physical-channel-procedure">8.3.2 Physical channel
procedure</h3>
<h4 id="random-access-procedure">8.3.2.1 Random access procedure</h4>
<h5 id="preamble">8.3.2.1.1 Preamble </h5>
<p>NR defines that</p>
<p>- a random access preamble format consists of one or multiple random
access preamble(s),</p>
<p>- a random access preamble consists of one preamble sequence plus CP,
and</p>
<p>- one preamble sequence consists of one or multiple RACH OFDM
symbol(s)</p>
<p>UE transmits PRACH according to the configured random access preamble
format.</p>
<p>NR supports multiple RACH preamble formats, including at least RACH
preamble formats with longer preamble length and shorter preamble
length. Multiple/repeated RACH preambles in a RACH resource are
supported. Numerology for RACH preamble can be different depending on
frequency ranges. Numerology for RACH preamble can be different from or
the same as that for the other UL data/control channels.</p>
<p>For a single RACH preamble transmission, CP/GT are required. For
example, the single RACH preamble would be used when Tx/Rx beam
correspondence held at both TRxP and UE for multi-beam operation.</p>
<p>For single/multi-beam operation, the following multiple/repeated RACH
preamble transmission is at least supported.</p>
<p>- CP is inserted at the beginning of the consecutive
multiple/repeated RACH OFDM symbols, CP/GT between RACH symbols is
omitted and GT is reserved at the end of the consecutive
multiple/repeated RACH symbols</p>
<p>The region for PRACH transmission is aligned to the boundary of
uplink symbol/slot/subframe. For supporting various coverage and forward
compatibility, flexibility in the length of CP/GT and the number of
repeated RACH preambles and RACH symbols is supported. Note that
specific use of the RACH preamble transmission may depend on RACH
subcarrier spacing and TRxP beam correspondence.</p>
<h5 id="procedure">8.3.2.1.2 Procedure</h5>
<p>RACH procedure including RACH preamble (Msg. 1), random access
response (Msg. 2), message 3, and message 4 is assumed for NR from
physical layer perspective. Random access procedure is supported for
both IDLE mode and CONNECTED mode UEs. For 4-step RACH procedure, a RACH
transmission occasion is defined as the time-frequency resource on which
a PRACH message 1 is transmitted using the configured PRACH preamble
format with a single particular tx beam</p>
<p>RACH resource is also defined as a time-frequency resource to send
RACH preamble. Whether UE needs to transmit one or multiple/repeated
preamble within a subset of RACH resources can be informed by broadcast
system information, e.g., to cover gNB RX beam sweeping in case of NO
Tx/Rx beam correspondence at the gNB.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Tx/Rx beam correspondence is available or not
at gNB at least for multiple beams operation, the following RACH
procedure is considered for at least UE in idle mode. Association
between one or multiple occasions for DL broadcast channel/signal and a
subset of RACH resources is informed to UE by broadcast system
information or known to UE. Based on the DL measurement and the
corresponding association, UE selects the subset of RACH preamble
indices. UE Tx beam(s) for preamble transmission(s) is selected by the
UE. During a RACH transmission occasion of single or multiple/repeated
preamble(s) as informed by broadcast system information, UE uses the
same UE Tx beam. NR at least supports transmission of a single Msg.1
before the end of a monitored RAR window.</p>
<p>At least for the case without gNB Tx/Rx beam correspondence, gNB can
configure an association between DL signal/channel, and a subset of RACH
resources and/or a subset of preamble indices, for determining Msg2 DL
Tx beam. Based on the DL measurement and the corresponding association,
UE selects the subset of RACH resources and/or the subset of RACH
preamble indices. A preamble index consists of preamble sequence index
and OCC index, if OCC is supported. Note that a subset of preambles can
be indicated by OCC indices.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Tx/Rx beam correspondence is available or not
at gNB at least for multiple beams operation, at gNB, the DL Tx beam for
message 2 can be obtained based on the detected RACH preamble/resource
and the corresponding association. UL grant in message 2 may indicate
the transmission timing of message 3. As baseline UE behavior, UE
assumes single RAR reception within a given RAR window.</p>
<p>At least for UE in idle mode, UL Tx beam for message 3 transmission
is determined by UE. UE may use the same UL Tx beam used for message 1
transmission.</p>
<p>Different PRACH configurations will be supported, e.g., considering
different numerologies case and whether Tx/Rx beam correspondence is
available or not at gNB.</p>
<p>For NR RACH Msg. 1 retransmission at least for multi-beam operation,
NR supports power ramping. If UE doesn’t change beam, the counter of
power ramping keeps increasing. Note that UE may derive the uplink
transmit power using the most recent estimate of path loss. Whether UE
performs UL Beam switching during retransmissions is up to UE
implementation. Note that which beam UE switches to is up to UE
implementation.</p>
<h4 id="scheduling-1">8.3.2.2 Scheduling</h4>
<p>NR supports both data and control with the same numerology. The
same-slot and cross-slot scheduling for UL is supported. Timing between
UL assignment and corresponding UL data transmission is indicated by a
field in the DCI from a set of values and the set of values is
configured by higher layer. For slot-based scheduling, UL assignment in
slot <em>N</em> and corresponding uplink data transmission in slot
<em>N</em>+<em>K</em>2 is to be specified. The timing(s) is (are)
defined at least for the case where the timing(s) is (are) unknown to
the UE. Both contiguous and non-contiguous resource allocation for data
with CP-OFDM is supported.</p>
<p>At least an UL transmission scheme without grant is supported for
URLLC. Resource may or may not be shared among one or more users. Also,
an UL transmission scheme without grant is targeted to be supported for
mMTC. For UL transmission without grant, the resource configuration
includes at least time and frequency resources, modulation and coding
scheme(s), possibly including RV, implicitly or explicitly, and
reference signal parameters. For UE configured with <em>K</em>
repetitions for a TB transmission with/without grant, the UE can
continue repetitions for the TB until one of the following conditions is
met.</p>
<p>- If an UL grant is successfully received for a slot/mini-slot for
the same TB</p>
<p>- The number of repetitions for that TB reaches <em>K</em></p>
<p>- Note that this does not assume that UL grant is scheduled based on
the slot whereas grant free allocation is based on mini-slot (vice
versa)</p>
<h4 id="power-control">8.3.2.3 Power control</h4>
<p>For NR-PUSCH at least targeting eMBB, both open-loop and closed-loop
power controls are supported. Open-loop based on pathloss estimate is
supported where pathloss measurement for UL power control is to be based
on at least one type of DL RS for beam measurement. Note that beam
measurement RS includes CSI-RS, RS defined for mobility purpose. The
same gNB antenna port can be used for pathloss measurement for multiple
processes.</p>
<p>Fractional power control is supported. Closed-loop power control is
based on NW signaling. Dynamic UL-power adjustment is considered.</p>
<p>Separate power control process can be supported for transmission of
different channel/RS (i.e., PUSCH, PUCCH, SRS).</p>
<p>NR supports beam specific power control as baseline. Power control
for UE side multiple panel transmission is supported.</p>
<h4 id="harq-1">8.3.2.4 HARQ</h4>
<p>Operation of more than one UL HARQ processes is supported for a given
UE while operation of one UL HARQ process is also supported for some
UEs. Asynchronous and adaptive UL HARQ is supported at least for
eMBB.</p>
<h2 id="duplexing">8.4 Duplexing</h2>
<p>NR supports paired and unpaired spectrum and strives to maximize
commonality between the technical solutions, allowing FDD operation on a
paired spectrum, different transmission directions in either part of a
paired spectrum, TDD operation on an unpaired spectrum where the
transmission direction of time resources is not dynamically changed, and
TDD operation on an unpaired spectrum where the transmission direction
of most time resources can be dynamically changing. DL and UL
transmission directions at least for data can be dynamically assigned on
a per-slot basis at least in a TDM manner. It is noted that transmission
directions include all of downlink, uplink, sidelink, and backhaul link.
NR supports at least semi-statically assigned DL/UL transmission
direction as gNB operation, i.e., the assigned DL/UL transmission
direction can be signaled to UE by higher layer signaling.</p>
<h2 id="lte-nr-co-existence">8.5 LTE-NR Co-existence</h2>
<p>To support the efficient coexistence between NR and LTE operating in
the same licensed frequency band, at least legacy LTE features should be
considered in the NR study, e.g.:</p>
<p>- MBSFN configuration (for LTE Rel-8 and beyond)</p>
<p>- TDD UL subframe (for LTE Rel-8 and beyond)</p>
<p>- SCell activation/deactivation (for LTE Rel-10 and beyond)</p>
<p>- TDD UL subframe configured by eIMTA feature (for LTE Rel-12 and
beyond)</p>
<p>For LTE and NR coexistence, support the following features in NR
design.</p>
<p>- Adapting the bandwidth occupied by NR carrier(s) at least as fast
as LTE carrier aggregation schemes</p>
<p>- Allowing NR transmissions while avoiding OFDM symbols carrying SRS
on an UL LTE subframe</p>
<p>For LTE and NR coexistence, in NR design, support of flexible
starting point and duration of scheduled resources are considered as a
tool to avoid for example the control region of MBSFN subframes and be
able to use resources in the unused MBSFN subframes of an LTE
carrier.</p>
<p>Note: these mechanisms may be reused from forward compatibility
mechanisms</p>
<p>NR downlink is supported in MBSFN subframes of LTE.</p>
<p>For adjacent channel/band operation of NR and LTE in the unpaired
spectrum, NR supports efficient adjacent channel co-existence with
LTE-TDD using UL-DL configurations 0,1,2,3,4,5 in unpaired spectrum. NR
also supports efficient adjacent channel co-existence with LTE-TDD using
all the special subframe configurations in unpaired spectrum. The above
adjacent channel co-existence with LTE-TDD does not necessarily imply
that two or more frame structures are to be defined for NR. The wording
“efficient” in the above two bullets does not imply exact alignment of
configurations.</p>
<p>Note that DL/UL interference also can be avoided by using dynamically
assigned DL/UL transmission direction in some cases.</p>
<p>It is noted that support or design for the above features do not
imply that UE has to support simultaneous connection of NR and LTE in
the same or overlapping carrier. Also note that the above mechanisms may
be reused from forward compatibility mechanisms, or mechanisms for
multiplexing eMBB and URLLC on the DL, or mini-slot.</p>
<p>NR supports the case when an NR UE is not expected to understand or
detect LTE signals/channels in the frequency band shared by NR and LTE.
Initial access procedure design for NR should be used as a baseline for
the case of NR-LTE coexisting.</p>
<p>LTE-NR co-existence should support the following UL sharing
scenarios. Collocated LTE and NR base stations with network operating UL
on frequency F1 where LTE UL and NR UL share UL subframes of LTE. LTE DL
on a paired frequency F3 NR DL transmission on frequency F2 (different
than LTE DL frequency). NR UE operates in either of the following cases
based on a common NR design:</p>
<p>- Standalone NR: UE accesses standalone NR carrier on F2. The UE may
not be connected to an LTE carrier (some UE may not even support
LTE).</p>
<p>- Dual connectivity of LTE and NR: UE accesses LTE PCell (with LTE UL
on F1), then is configured by dual connectivity to also operate NR on F1
(UL) and F2 (DL).</p>
<p>- NR DL and UL frequencies (and/or NR band number) are signaled by
RRC</p>
<h2 id="carrier-aggregation-dual-connectivity">8.6 Carrier Aggregation /
Dual Connectivity</h2>
<p>For phase 1, carrier aggregation/dual connectivity operation within
NR carriers over e.g. around 1GHz contiguous and non- contiguous
spectrum from both NW and UE perspectives is supported. Carrier
aggregation including different carriers having same or different
numerologies is supported. From RAN1 specification perspective, the
maximum number of NR carriers for CA and DC is 16. The number of NR CCs
in any aggregation is independently configured for downlink and uplink.
NR channel designs should consider potential future extension of the
maximum number of NR carriers in later releases, allowing Rel-15 UE to
have access to NR network on the same frequency band in later
release.</p>
<p>Cross-carrier scheduling and joint UCI feedback are supported.</p>
<p>Per-carrier TB mapping is supported.</p>

transmission direction).</p>
<p>The combination of one numerology as described in sub-clause 8.1 and

<p>Which numerologies and/or TTI durations a logical channel of a radio

and/or TTI durations, and ARQ can operate on any of the numerologies
and/or TTI durations the logical channel is configured with.</p>
<p>A single MAC entity can support one or multiple numerologies and/or

<p>Figure 9.8.2-1: UE state machine and state transitions in NR</p>
<p>Paging operation details for the NR RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE state
are specified in 10.1.1.2.</p>
<p>The following state transitions are supported between the
aforementioned RRC states (as also presented in Figure 9.8.2-1):</p>
<p>- from RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED, following the "connection setup"
procedure (e.g. request, setup, complete);</p>
<p>- from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE, following (at least) the
"connection release" procedure;</p>
<p>- from RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_INACTIVE, following the "connection
inactivation" procedure;</p>
<p>- from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_CONNECTED, following the "connection
activation" procedure;</p>
<p>- from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE.</p>
<h4 id="ran-based-notification-are-management">9.8.2.1 RAN-based
notification are management</h4>
<p>A UE in the RRC_INACTIVE state can be configured with the RAN-based
notification area, whereupon:</p>
<p>- a notification area can cover a single or multiple cells, and can
be smaller than CN area;</p>
<p>- a UE does not send any "location update" indication when it stays
within the boundaries of the notification area;</p>
<p>- leaving the area, a UE updates its location to the network.</p>
<p>There are several different options on how the RAN-based notification
area can be configured:</p>
<p>- List of cells;</p>
<p>- A UE is provided an explicit list of cells (one or more) that
constitute the RAN-based notification area.</p>
<p>- RAN area.</p>
<p>- A UE is provided (at least one) RAN area ID;</p>
<p>- A cell broadcasts (at least one) RAN area ID in the system
information so that a UE knows which area the cell belongs to.</p>
<p>NOTE 2: A list with cells may contain only one entry implementing
RAN-based notification area comprising one cell.</p>
<h3 id="system-information-handling">9.8.3 System information
handling</h3>
<p>System information is divided into minimum SI and other SI. Minimum
SI is periodically broadcast. The minimum SI comprises basic information
required for initial access to a cell and information for acquiring any
other SI broadcast periodically or provisioned via on-demand basis, i.e.
scheduling information. The other SI encompasses everything not
broadcast in the minimum SI.</p>
<p>The other SI may either be broadcast, or provisioned in a dedicated
manner, either triggered by the network or upon request from the UE as
illustrated in Figure 9.8.3-1. For the other SI required by the UE,
before the UE sends the other SI request the UE needs to know whether it
is available in the cell and whether it is broadcast or not. The UE in
RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE should be able to request the other SI without
requiring a state transition. For the UE in RRC_CONNECTED, dedicated RRC
signaling can be used for the request and delivery of the other SI. The
other SI may be broadcast at configurable periodicity and for certain
duration. It is network decision whether the other SI is broadcast or
delivered through dedicated UE specific RRC signaling.</p>
<p>Each cell on which the UE is allowed to camp broadcasts at least some
contents of the minimum SI, while there may be cells in the system on
which the UE cannot camp and do not broadcast the minimum SI. For a
cell/frequency that is considered for camping by the UE, the UE should
not be required to acquire the contents of the minimum SI of that
cell/frequency from another cell/frequency layer. This does not preclude
the case that the UE applies stored SI from previously visited cell(s).
If the UE cannot determine the full contents of the minimum SI of a cell
(by receiving from that cell or from valid stored SI from previous
cells), the UE shall consider that cell as barred. It is desirable for
the UE to learn very quickly that this cell cannot be camped on.</p>

<h4 id="dual-connectivity-between-lte-and-nr">9.8.3.1 Dual Connectivity
between LTE and NR</h4>
<p>For DC between LTE and NR where MCG comprises LTE cell(s) and SCG
comprises NR cell(s), the gNB as the secondary node is not required to
broadcast system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN.
In this case, system information (for initial configuration) is provided
for the UE by dedicated RRC signalling via LTE eNB as the master node.
The UE acquires, at least, radio frame timing and SFN of SCG from the
NR-PSS/SSS and PBCH of NR PSCell.</p>
<p>For DC between LTE and NR where MCG comprises NR cell(s) and SCG
comprises LTE cell(s), system information (for initial configuration) is
provided for the UE by dedicated RRC signalling via NR gNB as the master
node. In this case, the UE acquires radio frame timing and SFN of SCG
from PSS/SSS and MIB on LTE PSCell.</p>
<h3 id="measurements">9.8.4 Measurements</h3>
<p>For the cell level mobility driven by RRC described in sub-clause
13.2.1.2, the baseline of the RRM measurement framework for DL is the
one specified for LTE (measurement object, measurement ID, reporting
configuration) as specified in TS 36.331 [8]. The DL RRM measurement
should be performed based on a common framework regardless of network
and UE beam configurations (e.g. number of beams). As for the event
triggered reporting, Event A1 to A6 like the ones specified for LTE are
at least to be supported with potential modifications. Other events may
also be studied for NR. Measurement report contains at least cell level
measurement results.</p>
<p>A UE in RRC_CONNECTED should be able to perform RRM measurements on
always on idle RS (e.g. NR-PSS/SSS) and/or CSI-RS. The gNB should be
able to configure RRM measurements via dedicated signalling to be
performed on CSI-RS and/or idle RS. The event triggered reporting can be
configured for NR-PSS/SSS and for CSI-RS for RRM measurements. At least,
Even A1 to A6 can be configured for NR-PSS/SSS.</p>
<p>In the multi-beam operation, the UE in RRC_CONNECTED measures at
least one or more individual DL beams. The gNB should have the
mechanisms to consider the measurement results of those DL beams for
handover. This mechanism is needed at least to trigger inter-gNB
handover and to optimise handover ping-pong and failure. The UE should
be able to distinguish between the beams from its serving cell and the
beams from neighbour cells. The UE should be able to learn if a beam is
coming from its serving cell. Cell level signalling quality for the DL
RRM measurement can be derived from N best beams, if detected, where the
value of N can be configured to 1 or more than 1. This does not preclude
the DL RRM measurement on a single beam. Measurement report may contain
the measurement results of the N best beams if the UE is configured to
do so by the gNB.</p>
<h4 id="dual-connectivity-between-lte-and-nr-1">9.8.4.1 Dual
Connectivity between LTE and NR</h4>
<p>If the measurement is configured to the UE in preparation for the
Secondary Node Addition procedure described in sub-clause 13.2.3, the
master node should configure the measurement to the UE. In case of the
intra-secondary node mobility described in sub-clause 13.2.3, the
secondary node should configure the measurement to the UE in
coordination with the master node, if required. For the secondary node
change procedure described in sub-clause 13.2.3, the RRM measurement
configuration is maintained by the secondary node which also processes
measurement reporting.</p>
<h3 id="access-control">9.8.5 Access control</h3>
<p>The NR system should support overload and access control
functionality such as RACH backoff, RRC Connection Reject, RRC
Connection Release and UE based access barring mechanisms.</p>
<p>One unified access barring mechanism for NR should be introduced to
address all the use cases and scenarios that LTE addressed with
different specialized mechanisms. The unified access barring mechanism
should be forward compatible in order to cope with future use
cases/scenarios.</p>
<p>In NR, the unified access barring mechanism should be applicable for
all RRC states in NR (RRC_IDLE, RRC_CONNECTED and RRC_INACTIVE).</p>
<h3 id="ue-capability-retrieval-framework">9.8.6 UE capability retrieval
framework</h3>
<p>The UE reports its UE radio access capabilities which are static at
least when the network requests. The gNB can request what capabilities
for the UE to report (e.g. similar band and band combination requests in
LTE). The change of UE capabilities is just to, temporarily (e.g. under
network control), limit the availability of some capabilities, e.g. due
to hardware sharing, interference or overheating. The temporary
capability restrict should be transparent to the NextGen Core. Namely,
only static capability is stored in the NextGen Core. The UE signals the
temporary capability restriction request to the gNB.</p>

in NR and NextGen Core</h2>
<p>The QoS architecture in NR and NextGen Core is depicted in the Figure
11.1-1 and described in the following:</p>
<p>- For each UE, the NextGen Core establishes one or more PDU
Sessions.</p>
<p>- For each UE, the RAN establishes one or more Data Radio Bearers per
PDU Session. The RAN maps packets belonging to different PDU sessions to
different DRBs. Hence, the RAN establishes at least one default DRB for
each PDU Session indicated by the CN upon PDU Session establishment.</p>
<p>- NAS level packet filters in the UE and in the NextGen Core
associate UL and DL packets with QoS Flows.</p>
<p>- AS-level mapping in the UE and in the RAN associate UL and DL QoS
Flows with Data Radio Bearers (DRB).</p>
<p><img src="media/image33.svg" /></p>
<p><mark>Figure 11.1-1</mark>: QoS architecture in NR and NextGen
Core</p>
<p>NextGen Core and RAN ensure quality of service (e.g. reliability and
target delay) by mapping packets to appropriate QoS Flows and DRBs.
Hence there is a 2-step mapping of IP-flows to QoS flows (NAS) and from
QoS flows to DRBs (Access Stratum).</p>
<p>In NR, the data radio bearer (DRB) defines the packet treatment on
the radio interface (Uu).</p>
<p>A DRB serves packets with the same packet forwarding treatment.
Separate DRBs may be established for QoS flows requiring different
packet forwarding treatment.</p>
<p>In the downlink, the RAN maps QoS Flows to DRBs based on NG3 marking
(QoS Flow ID) and the associated QoS profiles.</p>
<p>In the uplink, the UE marks uplink packets over Uu with the QoS flow
ID for the purposes of marking forwarded packets to the CN.</p>
<p>In the uplink, the RAN may control the mapping of QoS Flows to DRB in
two different ways:</p>
<p>- Reflective mapping: for each DRB, the UE monitors the QoS flow
ID(s) of the downlink packets and applies the same mapping in the
uplink; that is, for a DRB, the UE maps the uplink packets belonging to
the QoS flows(s) corresponding to the QoS flow ID(s) and PDU Session
observed in the downlink packets for that DRB. To enable this reflective
mapping, the RAN marks downlink packets over Uu with QoS flow ID.</p>
<p>- Explicit Configuration: besides the reflective mapping, the RAN may
configure by RRC an uplink “QoS Flow to DRB mapping”.</p>
<p>If an incoming UL packet matches neither an RRC configured nor a
reflective “QoS Flow ID to DRB mapping”, the UE shall map that packet to
the default DRB of the PDU session.</p>
<p>Within each PDU session, is up to RAN how to map multiple QoS flows
to a DRB. The RAN may map a GBR flow and a non-GBR flow, or more than
one GBR flow to the same DRB, but mechanisms to optimise these cases are
not within the scope of standardization. The timing of establishing
non-default DRB(s) between RAN and UE for QoS flow configured during
establishing a PDU session can be different from the time when the PDU
session is established. It is up to RAN when non-default DRBs are
established.</p>
<h2 id="dual-connectivity-between-lte-and-nr-via-epc">11.2 Dual
Connectivity between LTE and NR via EPC</h2>
<p>For the DC architecture connecting to EPC in which eNB is the master
node and gNB is the secondary node, an SCG bearer is established such
that there is a one-to-one mapping between an S1 bearer and a DRB. For
this architecture option, the PDCP layer for an SCG bearer is NR PDCP.
For an SCG split bearer connected to EPC, there is a one-to-one mapping
between an S1 bearer and a DRB.</p>
<h1 id="support-for-network-slicing">12 Support for Network Slicing</h1>
<p>Network Slicing is a new concept to allow differentiated treatment
depending on each customer requirements. With slicing, it is possible
for Mobile Network Operators (MNO) to consider customers as belonging to
different tenant types with each having different service requirements
that govern in terms of what slice types each tenant is eligible to use
based on Service Level Agreement (SLA) and subscriptions.</p>
<p>RAN will use information provided by the UE to route NAS messages to
the appropriate NGC CP function. It should be possible for a single RAN
node to support multiple slices. In case a UE is associated with
multiple slices simultaneously, only one signalling connection shall be
maintained.</p>
<p>RAN shall support the selection of the RAN part of the network slice,
by information provided by the UE or the CN, in order to support a
differentiated handling of traffic for different network slices. How RAN
supports the network slices in terms of RAN functions (i.e. the set of
network functions that comprise each slice) is implementation
dependent.</p>
<p>The RAN should be free to apply the best RRM policy for the SLA in
place to each supported slice and shall support resource isolation
between slices which may be achieved by means of RRM policies and
protection mechanisms that should avoid that shortage of shared
resources in one slice breaks the service level agreement for another
slice. It should also be possible to fully dedicate RAN resources to a
certain slice. How RAN supports resource isolation is implementation
dependent.</p>
<p>Some slices may be available only in part of the network. The RAN and
the CN are responsible to handle a service request for a slice that may
or may not be available in a given area. It is assumed (see TR 23.799
[11]) that the slice configuration does not change within the UE’s
registration area.</p>

<h2 id="initial-access">13.1 Initial access</h2>
<h3 id="cell-selection">13.1.1 Cell selection</h3>
<p>Cell selection is performed by one of the following two
procedures:</p>
<p>a) Initial cell selection (no prior knowledge of which RF channels
are NR carriers);</p>
<p>1. The UE shall scan all RF channels in the NR bands according to its
capabilities to find a suitable cell.</p>
<p>2. On each carrier frequency, the UE need only search for the
strongest cell.</p>
<p>3. Once a suitable cell is found this cell shall be selected.</p>
<p>b) Cell selection by leveraging stored information.</p>
<p>1. This procedure requires stored information of carrier frequencies
and optionally also information on cell parameters, from previously
received measurement control information elements or from previously
detected cells.</p>
<p>2. Once the UE has found a suitable cell the UE shall select it.</p>
<p>3. If no suitable cell is found the Initial Cell Selection procedure
shall be started.</p>
<p>The following three levels of services are provided while a UE is in
RRC_IDLE:</p>
<p>- Limited service (emergency calls, ETWS and CMAS on an acceptable
cell);</p>
<p>- Normal service (for public use on a suitable cell);</p>
<p>- Operator service (for operators only on a reserved cell).</p>
<p>The definition of an acceptable cell, a suitable cell, a barred cell
and a reserved cell is also applicable for cell selection in NR. A cell
is considered as suitable if the following conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<p>- Measurement quality of a cell is above a threshold;</p>
<p>- A cell is served by the selected/registered PLMN and not
barred.</p>
<p>In multi-beam operations, measurement quantity of a cell is derived
amongst the beams corresponding to the same cell.</p>
<h3 id="random-access-procedure-1">13.1.2 Random access procedure</h3>
<p>The random access procedure supports both contention-based and
contention free random accesses which follow the steps defined for LTE
as illustrated in Figure 13.1.2-1. The design of random access procedure
needs to support flexible Msg.3 size (as already supported in LTE).</p>

<p>The following cell reselection methods as specified in TS 36.304 [7]
are applicable based on the corresponding parameters broadcast while the
UE is camping on a cell in NR:</p>
<p>- Intra-frequency reselection is based on ranking of cells.</p>
<p>- Inter-frequency reselection is based on absolute priorities.</p>
<p>- Inter-RAT reselection can be also based on absolute priorities.</p>
<p>- Frequency specific cell reselection parameters common to all
neighbouring cells on a frequency;</p>
<p>- Service specific prioritisation;</p>
<p>- A concept of neighbour cell lists and black cell lists;</p>
<p>- Speed dependent cell reselection.</p>
<p>In multi-beam operations, measurement quantity of a cell is derived

can be configured to 1 or more than 1.</p>
<h5 id="paging-1">13.2.1.1.2 Paging</h5>
<p>The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE states may use Discontinuous
Reception (DRX) in order to reduce power consumption. While in RRC_IDLE
the UE monitors CN-initiated paging, in RRC_INACTIVE the UE is reachable
via RAN-initiated paging and CN-initiated paging. RAN and CN paging
occasions overlap and same paging mechanism is used. The UE monitors one
paging occasion per DRX cycle for the reception of paging as
follows:</p>
<p>- Paging DRX cycle length is configurable;</p>
<p>- A default DRX cycle for CN paging is configurable via system
information;</p>
<p>- A UE specific DRX cycle for CN paging is configurable via UE
dedicated signaling;</p>
<p>- A RAN node can configure a UE with a DRX cycle for RAN paging. This
configuration can be UE specific.</p>
<p>- The number of paging occasions in a DRX cycle is configurable via
system information;</p>
<p>- A network may distribute UEs to the paging occasions based on UE id
when multiple paging occasions are configured in the DRX cycle.</p>
<p>- Paging occasion can consist of multiple time slots (e.g. subframe
or OFDM symbol). The number of time slots in a paging occasion is
configurable via system information.</p>
<p>- A network may transmit a paging using a different set of DL Tx
beam(s) or repetitions in each time slot.</p>
<h4 id="network-controlled-mobility">13.2.1.2 Network controlled
mobility</h4>
<p>Network controlled mobility is applied for the UE in RRC_CONNECTED
and is dealt with or without RRC. The RRC driven mobility is responsible
for the cell level mobility, i.e. handover. Handover signalling
procedures adopt the same principle as Rel-13 LTE as specified in TS
36.300 [12]. For inter-gNB handover, the signalling procedures consist
of at least the following elemental components illustrated in Figure
13.2.1.2-1:</p>
<p><img src="media/image36.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 13.2.1.2-1: Inter-gNB handover procedures</p>
<p>1 The source gNB initiates handover and issues a Handover Request
over the Xn interface.</p>
<p>2 The target gNB performs admission control and provides the RRC
configuration as part of the Handover Acknowledgement.</p>
<p>3 The source gNB provides the RRC configuration to the UE in the
Handover Command. The Handover Command message includes at least cell ID
and all information required to access the target cell so that the UE
can access the target cell without reading system information. For some
cases, the information required for contention based and contention free
random access can be included in the Handover Command message. The
access information to the target cell may include beam specific
information, if any.</p>
<p>4 The UE moves the RRC connection to the target gNB and replies the
Handover Complete.</p>
<p>NOTE 1: Further enhancements and modifications can be considered.</p>
<p>The handover mechanism driven by RRC requires the UE at least to
reset the MAC entity if multi-connectivity is not configured for the UE.
The handover with and without re-establishing the PDCP entity is
supported. In-sequence and lossless delivery without duplicates (from
upper layer viewpoint) is supported for handover within NR.</p>
<p>For mobility without RRC, it is dealt with PHY and/or MAC on the beam
or TRxP level. As such, intra-cell mobility can be handled by mobility
without RRC. One gNB corresponds to one or many TRxPs.</p>
<h3 id="inter-rat">13.2.2 Inter-RAT</h3>
<p>The following list defines the mobility support between NR and LTE
connected to NG Core and EPC. (see Figure 13.2.2-1).</p>
<p>1) Support for HO between NR and LTE connected to EPC depends on SA2
decisions and support of NGx with context mapping between NG Core and
EPC. If supported, from RAN2 perspective, a “conventional” S1/NG based
HO procedure is used where the target RAT receives the UE S1 context
information and based on this information configures the UE with a
complete RRC message and Full configuration (not delta).</p>
<p>NOTE: RAN2 does not consider direct RAN interface between eNB
connected to EPC and NR. This does not preclude indirect data forwarding
over S1-NG-C being considered by other WGs without any RAN2 impact.</p>
<p>2) Both Xn and CN HO between LTE connected to NG Core and NR is
supported by RAN2 specifications. The target RAT receives the UE NG-C
context information and based on this information configures the UE with
a complete RRC message and Full configuration (not delta). Whether the
HO is over Xn or CN is transparent to the UE.</p>
<p>3) The in-sequence and lossless HO as described in sub-clause 10.1.2
is supported the handover between RAN nodes (eNB and gNB) connected to
NG Core.</p>
<p>4) Source RAT should be able to support and configure Target RAT
measurement and reporting for inter-RAT HO.</p>

Mobility related to Dual Connectivity between LTE and NR</h3>
<p>The following procedures are the baseline for DC between LTE and
NR:</p>
<p>- Secondary Node Addition procedure triggered by the master node;</p>
<p>- Secondary Node Release procedure triggered by both the master node
and the secondary node;</p>
<p>- Intra-secondary Node mobility triggered by the secondary node;</p>
<p>- Addition/Release of SCell within the secondary node triggered by
the secondary node;</p>
<p>- Secondary Node Change procedure triggered by the secondary
node.</p>
<p>Intra-secondary node mobility should be managed by the secondary node
itself. PSCell change and SCell addition/release are regarded as the
part of the intra-secondary node mobility. At least in some cases, the
master node needs to be informed of the occurrence of the
intra-secondary node mobility. The master node is involved and takes the
final decision before the secondary node change occurs in some
cases.</p>
<h2 id="dual-connectivity-between-nr-and-lte">13.3 Dual Connectivity

<h3 id="general">13.3.1 General</h3>
<p>Option 3/3a/3x, 4/4a and 7/7a/7x of deployment scenarios can be
considered as tight interworking between NR and E-UTRA.</p>
<p>In Option 3/3a, Dual Connectivity (DC) specified in TS 36.300 [12]
and relevant stage 3 specifications (e.g., TS 36.423 [13]) should be
reused as baseline considering the fact that EPC should not be impacted.
Therefore, for the Xx interface between LTE eNB and gNB, the procedures
and protocols would remain alike those of DC, while minor enhancements
might not be ruled out. In Option 3x, further enhancements are needed on
top of LTE based DC .</p>
<p>In Option 4/4a, Dual Connectivity can be realized, in which the gNB
(similar role as MeNB in TS 36.300 [12]) is connected to the NGC with
Non-standalone E-UTRA (similar role as SeNB in TS 36.300 [12]). The
E-UTRA user plane connection to the NGC goes via the gNB (Option 4) or
directly (Option 4a). For the Xn interface between eLTE eNB and gNB, the
procedures and protocols should be newly designed.</p>
<p>In Option 7/7a/7x, Dual Connectivity can also be achieved, in which
the LTE eNB (similar role as MeNB in TS 36.300 [12]) is connected to the
NGC with Non-standalone NR (similar role as SeNB in TS 36.300 [12]). The

<p>In principle co-existence study in the study item should be include
both below 6GHz and above 6GHz. Due to time limitation, however, the
co-existence studies in the study item are focused on conducting those
for ITU-R WP 5D response purpose. Hence, the necessity of the
co-existence study for below 6GHz was not concluded.</p>
<p>RF parameters requests for sharing and compatibility studies with
other systems in ITU-R WP 5D came concurrently with the beginning of the
study item and the reply deadline was within the completion date of the
study item.</p>
<p>The frequency range for the RF parameters for ITU-R WP 5D are from
24.25 GHz to 86GHz.</p>
<p>The frequency range for the RF parameters for ITU-R WP 5D just
matches the frequency range where there are new challenges that 3GPP had
to address such as significantly high path loss due to the high
frequency and techniques such as beamforming to compensate for it.</p>
<p>To cover the wide frequency range requested by ITU-R WP 5D, the range
was divided into three ranges, 30 GHz, 45 GHz and 70 GHz. The
co-existence simulation was conducted based on the common simulation
assumptions captured in clause 5 of TR 38.803 (where the results sent to
ITU-R are also captured).</p>
<p>It is noted that it was agreed that some parameters derived in the
co-existence study in the study item are only used for ITU-R WP5D
response.</p>
<p>Apart from the co-existence simulation results, estimations of the
feasibility of achieving different ACLR levels, in particular the impact
of ACLR on deliverable output power and PA efficiency were presented
during the SI. The ACLR requirement will need to be set to ensure good
coexistence and be feasible.</p>

<h3 id="common-requirements-for-ue-and-bs">14.3.1 Common requirements
for UE and BS</h3>
<p>The target frequency range for NR in the study item is up to 52.6
GHz, which is much higher than that for current LTE. Specifically in
higher frequency range called mm Wave, where the possibility is
anticipated that allocated spectrum to each operator in mm Wave would be
even wider than that in lower frequency range such as below 6 GHz. Even
spectrum below 6GHz, however, there will be more continuous spectrum in
some frequency range such as around 2.6 GHz and 3.5 GHz. Hence, the
feasibility of maximum channel bandwidth with single carrier in both
below 6 GHz and above 6 GHz became one of the objectives in the study
item. In this context, the next interest was to what extent granularity
is required if a larger channel bandwidth is defined. It would be
natural for NR to have to deal with even larger number of finite channel
bandwidth set to meet various spectrum allocation patterns. Note that in
LTE this was compensated by allowing for a certain band to use a finite
set of six channel bandwidths and carrier aggregation with them at the
cost of some overhead such signalling. To gain better spectrum
utilization efficiency instead of using similar way of LTE with a finite
granularity and foreseeable even various spectrum allocation patterns,
flexible channel bandwidth concept was investigated for both UE and BS
in NR.</p>
<p>In addition, for this wider channel bandwidth, it is well known that
in general continuous usage of a wider channel bandwidth requires more
power than that of a smaller channel bandwidth. Hence, in order to
address it, feasibility of a concept of transmission bandwidth
configuration adaptation was also investigated. In this concept,
transmission bandwidth configuration within a channel bandwidth is not
always the maximum unlike LTE. The maximum transmission bandwidth as
well as its position can be adjusted to suitable one.</p>
<p>Moreover, one of the significant differences between LTE and NR is
that several sub-carrier spacings will be defined in RAN1 specifications
while the current LTE specification allows to use 15 kHz sub-carrier
spacing only. Note that NB-IoT is not considered. Hence, feasibility
study to identify suitable sub-carrier spacing in terms of frequency
range was conducted.</p>
<p>Finally, as one of the essential aspects for new RAT, spectrum
utilization was investigated.</p>
<h4 id="subcarrier-spacing">14.3.1.1 Subcarrier spacing</h4>
<p>Feasible subcarrier spacing for NR would depend on frequency range.
Based on the initial study, for below 6 GHz, the feasible sub-carrier
spacings were identified, while above 6 GHz, the study was able to go no
further than identifying potential candidates:</p>
<p>- For below 6GHz: 15kHz, 30 kHz and 60kHz are feasible</p>
<p>- For above 6GHz: 60kHz, 120kHz and 240kHz are potential candidates
of feasible subcarrier spacing.</p>
<p>It should be noted which of the above mentioned subcarrier spacings
are supported depends on NR bands where UE and gNB operate.</p>
<h4 id="maximum-channel-bandwidth">14.3.1.2 Maximum channel
bandwidth</h4>
<p>Maximum channel bandwidth was studied based on at least possible
sub-carrier spacings in a certain frequency range considering aspects
such as phase noise impact, FFT size etc. As the result, it was
concluded that from physical layer specification perspective the maximum
supportable channel bandwidth at this stage is 400MHz while from RF
feasibility perspective the ranges of the maximum channel bandwidth are
as follows:</p>
<p>- For below 6GHz: Maximum CBW will be further studied in range of
100MHz ~ 200MHz.</p>
<p>- For above 6GHz: Maximum CBW will be further studied in range of
100MHz ~ 1GHz</p>
<p>In addition, the necessity of the investigation of possibility to
support the above maximum channel bandwidth with carrier aggregation was
identified.. It should be noted that the maximum channel bandwidth
mentioned above may be not applicable to all bands.</p>
<h4 id="flexible-channel-bandwidth">14.3.1.3 Flexible channel
bandwidth</h4>
<p>It is clarified that the flexible channel bandwidth can potentially
be specified if it is established that RF requirements can be linearly
scalable with channel bandwidth or if RF requirements for a finite set
of channel bandwidth can ensure UE/gNB performance.</p>
<h4 id="ue-transmission-bandwidth-configuration-adaptation">14.3.1.4 UE
transmission bandwidth configuration adaptation</h4>
<p>In this concept, transmission bandwidth configuration within a
channel bandwidth is not always the maximum unlike LTE. The maximum
transmission bandwidth as well as its position can be adjusted to
suitable one. To study this feature, at least transmission time in both
RF and baseband side and power saving aspects were considered. As an
initial analysis, the following observations were obtained for
transition time specifically in terms of RF aspects:</p>
<p>- For intra-band operation, at least for below 6GHz, the transition
time can be up to 20µs if the centre frequency is the same before and
after the transmission bandwidth configuration adaptation.</p>
<p>- For intra-band operation, at least for below 6GHz, the transition
time is 50~200µs if the centre frequency is different before and after
the transmission bandwidth configuration adaptation.</p>
<p>- For inter-band operation, at least for below 6GHz, the transition
time can be up to 900µs.</p>
<h4 id="spectrum-utilization">14.3.1.5 Spectrum Utilization</h4>
<p>For LTE, the spectrum utilization is 90% at maximum in terms of RAN4
specification such as transmission bandwidth configuration of 20 MHz
channel bandwidth to be 18 MHz (100 PRBs). Spectrum utilization was
investigated at least in terms of spectrum utilization efficiency,
implementation complexity in both RF and digital baseband sides,
signalling complexity, specifications workload and testing burden. As
the result of the feasibility study, it is concluded that above 90% for
NR is feasible. Hence, better spectrum utilization for NR can be
achieved than that for LTE.</p>
<h3 id="ue-rf-requirements">14.3.2 UE RF requirements</h3>
<p>The frequency range of the scope of the study item was studied by
categorizing it as Range 1 and Range 2 as illustrated in Figure
14.3.2-1.</p>
<p><img src="media/image49.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>Figure 14.3.2-1: Frequency range 1/2 and the
threshold.</strong></p>
<h4 id="wide-frequency-range-of-up-to-52.6-ghz-handling">14.3.2.1 Wide
frequency range of up to 52.6 GHz handling</h4>
<p>For Range 1 of below 6 GHz, it was concluded that at least conducted
requirements are required and most of the requirements for LTE are
reusable such as spectrum emission mask for at least the same CBW as
that of LTE. Note that OTA based requirements are specified if
necessary.</p>
<p>For Range 2 of above 24 GHz, initially, OTA requirements as well as
conducted requirement including IF (intermediate frequency) possibility
were discussed. As the result, it was concluded that OTA requirements
only will be introduced into the requirements for this mm Wave frequency
range due to highly integrated architectures may feature innovative
front-end solutions, multi-element antenna arrays, passive and active
feeding networks, etc. that may not be able to physically expose a
front-end cable connector to the test equipment.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, highly integrated UE RF architectures are
proposed and captured into TR 38.803 where possible practical antenna
positions, the number of antenna arrays, RF front end etc. are
identified. For these challenges coming from mm Wave, methodologies to
specify each of the fundamental requirements being captured into TS
36.101 such as maximum output power, frequency error, spurious emission,
reference sensitivity, blocking as OTA were studied. During the study
item, as potential candidate methodologies, at least EIRP, TRxP and beam
peak were discussed. In the end, at least either of them is suitably
connected to each of the fundamental requirements. Moreover, for some of
the requirements such as maximum output power, spurious emissions,
reference sensitivity and out-of-band blocking, even specific
investigation was conducted. For instance, in the case of maximum output
power, roughly two aspects were discussed. One is power class (PC). It
was decided to develop requirements for one power class as priority.
After the requirement is defined, other PCs can be added. The other is
how to evaluate EIRP. During the study item, several UE types to develop
different spatial coverage requirements were identified, although
smartphone (i.e. full sphere) is the baseline of UE types in Rel-15.
Although final decision was not reached yet, intensive study was
conducted on specifically a CDF method for describing spherical coverage
of RF parameters where each point represents equal surface area in
sphere surrounding the UE.</p>
<h4 id="stand-alone-and-non-stand-alone-perspective">14.3.2.2
Stand-Alone and Non-Stand-Alone perspective</h4>
<p>Study of NSA between sub 6GHz band and mm Wave band were also
intensively conducted. Although a conclusion that no MSD issues was not
reached, at least most of the major factors were studied based on
currently available information such as data sheet of LNA, antenna
frequency response. The aspect as well as the MSD due to the impact of
the simultaneous two UL is supposed to be further investigated
considering challenges due to completely new UE design with mm Wave
components etc. In addition, necessity of power sharing mechanism
between LTE and NR was raised although the conclusion was not made since
it was observed that in some regions there are the radiation
exposure/absorption rules of SAR [W/Kg] for below 6 GHz and MPE
[mW/cm<sup>2</sup>] for above 6 GHz. Note that for NSA in both bands
below <mark>6</mark> GHz, it was identified that power sharing mechanism
between LTE and NR should be specified to meet SAR requirement in a the
same principle as UL CA/DC. It is, however, concluded that feasibility
of power sharing between different RATs is also to be further
investigated in terms of RAN1/2 specification and implementation as well
as other methods such as simply defining independent maximum power for
LTE and NR by leaving the compliance with the SAR to implementation.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-numerologies-within-one-carrier">14.3.2.3 Multiple
numerologies within one carrier</h4>
<p>Usage of multiple numerologies within one carrier which is one of the
major features was studied in terms of both UE and BS RF. For UE RF, it
was concluded that for reception side in channel selectivity requirement
will be newly introduced into a specification for NR UE RF corresponding
to TS 36.101 for LTE UE RF. The definition of the requirement follows
the same format as uplink, taking the possible power imbalance level
between numerologies into consideration. For transmission side, it was
concluded that EVM requirements measured over narrow bandwidth, which is
a few PRBs or 1 PRB, will be defined in addition to those measured over
all the PRBs.</p>
<h3 id="bs-rf-requirements">14.3.3 BS RF requirements</h3>
<p>The frequency range of the scope of the study item was studied by
categorizing it as Range 1 and Range 2 as illustrated in Figure
14.3.3-1.</p>
<p><img src="media/image50.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 14.3.3-1: Frequency range 1/2 and the threshold.</p>
<h4 id="wide-frequency-range-of-up-to-52.6-ghz-handling-1">14.3.3.1 Wide
frequency range of up to 52.6 GHz handling</h4>
<p>For Range 1 of below 6 GHz, it was concluded that both conducted
requirements and OTA requirements are required as RAN4 has non-AAS BS
specifications (i.e. with antenna connector based requirements without
antenna functionality consideration) and AAS BS specifications (i.e.
with antenna functionality considered and OTA requirements) for UTRA and
E-UTRA. In addition, the study comes to a conclusion that most of the
requirements for LTE are reusable such as BS class, output power
accuracy and spurious emission.</p>
<p>For Range 2 of above 24 GHz, initially, OTA requirements as well as
feasibility of having conducted requirements were discussed. As the
result, it was concluded that OTA requirements only will be introduced
into the requirements for this mm Wave frequency range due to highly
integrated architectures featuring innovative front-end solutions,
multi-element antenna arrays, passive and active feeding networks, etc.
that may not be able to physically expose a front-end cable connector to
the test equipment.</p>
<p>For this challenges coming from mm Wave, methodologies to specify
each of the fundamental requirements being captured into TS 36.104 such
as BS output power, EVM, ACLR, mask, spurious emission, reference
sensitivity, blocking as OTA were mainly studied. During the study item,
as potential candidate metrics, at least EIRP including the direction
and TRxP were discussed. In the end, at least either of them is suitably
connected to each of the fundamental requirements. It was agreed that
TRxP is the correct metric for ACLR, operating band unwanted emissions
and spurious emissions, with the exception of co-location related
spurious emissions Moreover, for some of the requirements such as BS
output power, EVM, ACLR, mask, spurious emissions, reference sensitivity
and out-of-band blocking, even specific investigation was conducted. For
instance, in the case of BS class and BS output power, roughly two
aspects were discussed. One is the definition of BS class. Although
existing BS classes were defined based on the minimum coupling loss
(MCL) between BS and UE, the conclusion was to use the minimum distance
between BS and UE instead of MCL for BS without antenna connector.
Although final decision was not reached yet, power limitation for each
BS class will be specified by TRxP. The other is metric for output power
accuracy requirement. It is required that EIRP accuracy at beam peak
direction should be met as requirement. The direction range where BS can
comply with the requirements will be declared by the BS vendor.</p>
<h4 id="multiple-numerologies-within-one-carrier-1">14.3.3.2 Multiple
numerologies within one carrier</h4>
<p>As a usage of multiple numerologies within one carrier which is one
of the major features was studied in terms of both UE and BS RF. For BS
RF, the following conclusions on the introduction of new requirements
into NR BS RF specification corresponding to TS 36.104 for LTE BS RF
were derived. For transmission, EVM requirements averaged over both all
the PRBs and 1 PRB at the edges will be defined for both single
numerology and multiple numerologies cases. For reception, in channel
selectivity requirement will be defined by considering two different
numerologies as wanted signal and interfere signal with taking the
possible power imbalance level.</p>
<h4 id="beam-related-nr-bs-specific-requirement">14.3.3.3 Beam related
NR BS specific requirement</h4>
<p>In the existing non-AAS specifications, antenna characteristics are
out of scope, requirements are specified at the antenna connector. AAS
BS specification already includes selected OTA requirements and eAAS
work continues to complete the OTA specification for UTRA and E-UTRA BS
below 6GHz.</p>
<p>Beam forming functionality is one of the essential capabilities to
compensate for large path loss for NR for &gt;24GHz range. For any
directional requirement such as EIRP accuracy or minimum EIS the
characteristics of the beam are included in the requirement hence, the
conclusion was that beam characteristics are included in the scope of
RAN4 OTA specifications already in the form of the EIRP and EIS
requirements. For &gt;24GHz some potential candidate new beam related
requirements to be specified were identified for further investigated.
The investigation will include the usefulness, suitability and
feasibility of the proposed requirements such that a decision can be
made in the WI on whether to include further beam related
requirements.</p>

<h2 id="justification">Justification</h2>
<p>Work has started in ITU and 3GPP to develop requirements and
specifications for new radio (NR) systems, as in the Recommendation
ITU-R M.2083 “Framework and overall objectives of the future development
of IMT for 2020 and beyond”, as well as 3GPP SA1 study item New Services
and Markets Technology Enablers (SMARTER) and SA2 study item
Architecture for NR System. In addition, a joint RAN-SA document
[SP-150149] from RAN#67 outlines the “NR” timeline for 3GPP, further
detailed in the September RAN workshop on NR [RWS-150073].</p>
<p>3GPP has to identify and develop the technology components needed for
successfully standardizing the NR system timely satisfying both the
urgent market needs, and the more long-term requirements set forth by
the ITU-R IMT-2020 process. Further, the NR system should be able to use
any spectrum band ranging at least up to 100 GHz that may be made
available for wireless communications even in a more distant future.</p>
<p>The [SP-150149] foresaw the following timeline</p>
<p>1) September 2015: RAN workshop</p>
<p>2) September 2015: Initiation of the channel modelling work needed
for the NR</p>
<p>3) December 2015: Initiation of the RAN Study Item: scope &amp;
requirements for the NR</p>
<p>4) March 2016: Initiation of the RAN WG SI: Identification and
evaluation of solutions</p>
<p>RAN#68 saw the first draft study item proposals for discussion for
points 2) [RP-150781] and 3) [RP-150813], and further RAN#69 saw the
first draft study item proposals for 4) in [RP-151278] and [RP-151551].
A study item on 2) [RP-151606] started in RAN#69.</p>
<p>This study item will address point 4) and build on the work done in
the three preceding steps, discussions in the RAN workshop on NR, and
the draft SIDs submitted to RAN#69.</p>
<h2 id="objective-of-si">Objective of SI</h2>
<p>The study aims to develop an NR access technology to meet a broad
range of use cases including enhanced mobile broadband, massive MTC,
critical MTC, and additional requirements defined during the RAN
requirements study.</p>
<p>The new RAT will consider frequency ranges up to 100 GHz
[TR38.913].</p>
<p>Detailed objectives of the study item are:</p>
<p>(1) Target a single technical framework addressing all usage
scenarios, requirements and deployment scenarios defined in TR38.913
including</p>
<p>- Enhanced mobile broadband</p>
<p>- Massive machine-type-communications</p>
<p>- Ultra reliable and low latency communications</p>
<p>(2) The new RAT shall be inherently forward compatible</p>
<p>- It is assumed that the normative specification would occur in two
phases: Phase I (to be completed in June 2018) and Phase II (to be
completed in December 2019)</p>
<p>- Phase I specification of the new RAT must be forward compatible (in
terms of efficient co-cell/site/carrier operation) with Phase II
specification and beyond, and backward compatibility to LTE is not
required</p>
<p>- Phase II specification of the new RAT builds on the foundation of
Phase I specification, and meets all the set requirements for the new
RAT.</p>
<p>- Smooth future evolution beyond Phase II needs to be ensured to
support later advanced features and to enable support of service
requirements identified later than Phase II specification.</p>
<p>(3) Initial work of the study item should allocate high priority on
gaining a common understanding on what is required in terms of radio
protocol structure and architecture to fulfil objective 1 and 2, with
focus on progressing in the following areas</p>
<p>- Fundamental physical layer signal structure for new RAT</p>
<p>- Waveform based on OFDM, with potential support of non-orthogonal
waveform and multiple access</p>
<p>- FFS: other waveforms if they demonstrate justifiable gain</p>
<p>- Basic frame structure(s)</p>
<p>- Channel coding scheme(s)</p>
<p>- Radio interface protocol architecture and procedures</p>
<p>- Radio Access Network architecture, interface protocols and
procedures,<br />
Study on the above 2 bullets shall at least cover:</p>
<p>- Study the feasibility of different options of splitting the
architecture into a "central unit" and a “distributed unit”, with
potential interface in between, including transport, configuration and
other required functional interactions between these nodes [RAN2,
RAN3];</p>
<p>- Study the alternative solutions with regard to signaling,
orchestration, …, and OAM, where applicable [in co-operation with
SA5];</p>
<p>- Study and outline the RAN-NextGen Core Network interface and
functional split [in co-operation with SA2] [RAN2, RAN3];<br />
Note: RAN, in this context, refers to a radio access network that
supports either Evolved E-UTRA or the new radio access technology or
both, interfacing with the next generation core [TR 23.799]</p>
<p>- Study and identify the basic structure and operation of realization
of RAN Networks functions (NFs). Study to what extent it is feasible to
standardize RAN NFs, the interfaces of RAN NFs and their interdependency
[RAN3];</p>
<p>- Study and identify specification impacts of enabling the
realization of Network Slicing [in co-operation with SA2] [RAN2,
RAN3];</p>
<p>- Study and identify additional architecture requirements e.g.
support for QoS concept, SON, support of sidelink for D2D [RAN1, RAN2,
RAN3].</p>
<p>- Fundamental RF aspects – especially where they may impact decisions
on the above, e.g.,</p>
<p>- Study and identify the aspects related to the testability of RF and
performance requirements</p>
<p>(4) Study and identify the technical features necessary to enable the
new radio access to meet objective 1 and 2, also including:</p>
<p>- Tight interworking between the new RAT and LTE</p>
<p>- Interworking with non-3GPP systems</p>
<p>- Operation in licensed bands (paired and unpaired), and licensed
assisted operations in unlicensed bands, including</p>
<p>- Survey on 60GHz regulatory landscape</p>
<p>- [Standalone operation in unlicensed bands is FFS]</p>
<p>- Efficient multiplexing of traffic for different services and use
cases on the same contiguous block of spectrum</p>
<p>- Stand alone operation in licensed bands</p>
<p>Note 1: The scope of Phase I will be determined when agreeing on
Phase I WID(s).</p>
<p>Note 2: Stated KPI values and deployment scenarios to be aligned to
scenarios and requirement SI outcome</p>
<p>(5) Provide performance evaluation of the technologies identified for
the new RAT and analysis of the expected specification work</p>
<p>(6) Identify relevant RF parameters used to be used for sharing and
co-existence studies</p>
<p>(7) Study and identify technical solutions that enable support for
wireless relay</p>
<p>(8) Study the channel models based on TR 38.900 to extend the
applicability range below 6GHz</p>
