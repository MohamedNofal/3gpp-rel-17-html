<p>This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).</p>
<p>The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work
within the TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the
TSG modify the contents of the present document, it will be re-released
by the TSG with an identifying change of release date and an increase in
version number as follows:</p>
<p>Version x.y.z</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>x the first digit:</p>
<p>1 presented to TSG for information;</p>
<p>2 presented to TSG for approval;</p>
<p>3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change
control.</p>
<p>y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e.
technical enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.</p>
<p>z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have
been incorporated in the document.</p>
<p>In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:</p>
<p><strong>shall</strong> indicates a mandatory requirement to do
something</p>
<p><strong>shall not</strong> indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to
do something</p>
<p>The constructions "shall" and "shall not" are confined to the context
of normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.</p>
<p>The constructions "must" and "must not" are not used as substitutes
for "shall" and "shall not". Their use is avoided insofar as possible,
and they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation
from an external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain
continuity of style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a
referenced document.</p>
<p><strong>should</strong> indicates a recommendation to do
something</p>
<p><strong>should not</strong> indicates a recommendation not to do
something</p>
<p><strong>may</strong> indicates permission to do something</p>
<p><strong>need not</strong> indicates permission not to do
something</p>
<p>The construction "may not" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions "might not" or "shall not" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.</p>
<p><strong>can</strong> indicates that something is possible</p>
<p><strong>cannot</strong> indicates that something is impossible</p>
<p>The constructions "can" and "cannot" are not substitutes for "may"
and "need not".</p>
<p><strong>will</strong> indicates that something is certain or expected
to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of
which is outside the scope of the present document</p>
<p><strong>will not</strong> indicates that something is certain or
expected not to happen as a result of action taken by an agency the
behaviour of which is outside the scope of the present document</p>
<p><strong>might</strong> indicates a likelihood that something will
happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which
is outside the scope of the present document</p>
<p><strong>might not</strong> indicates a likelihood that something will
not happen as a result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of
which is outside the scope of the present document</p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<p><strong>is</strong> (or any other verb in the indicative mood)
indicates a statement of fact</p>
<p><strong>is not</strong> (or any other negative verb in the indicative
mood) indicates a statement of fact</p>
<p>The constructions "is" and "is not" do not indicate requirements.</p>
<h1 id="scope">1 Scope</h1>
<p>The present document specifies requirements for support of Radio
Resource Management for the FDD and TDD modes of New Radio (NR). These
requirements include requirements on measurements in NR and the UE as
well as requirements on node dynamical behaviour and interaction, in
terms of delay and response characteristics.</p>
<h1 id="references">2 References</h1>
<p>The following documents contain provisions which, through reference
in this text, constitute provisions of the present document.</p>
<p>- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.</p>
<p>- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.</p>
<p>- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the
case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that
document <em>in the same Release as the present document</em>.</p>

<h2 id="test-tolerances">3.4 Test tolerances</h2>
<p>The requirements given in the present document make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification 38.533 [5] defines the
test tolerances.</p>
<h2 id="frequency-bands-grouping">3.5 Frequency bands grouping</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">3.5.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The intention with the frequency band grouping below is to increase
the readability of the specification.</p>
<p>The frequency bands grouping is derived based on UE REFSENS
requirements specified in [18, 19, 20] and assuming 0.5 dB step between
the neighbour groups. The groups are defined in the order of increasing
REFSENS, i.e., the group A has the smallest REFSENS among the groups.
For the same SCS and a given bandwidth, the bands within the same group
have the same Io conditions in a corresponding requirement in this
specification, provided the bands support this SCS. For different SCSs
supported by a frequency band and the same bandwidth, different Io
conditions may apply for the frequency band in the requirements, while
the band group is the same, based on the lowest REFSENS requirement
normalized by the number of subcarriers among its supported SCSs for
this bandwidth. For the same SCS but different supported bandwidths, the
group for a band is determined based on the lowest REFSENS requirement
normalized by the number of subcarriers among its supported
bandwidths.</p>

<h4 id="measurements-of-inter-frequency-nr-cells">4.2.2.4 Measurements
of inter-frequency NR cells</h4>
<p>The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and
perform SS-RSRP or SS-RSRQ measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by the serving cell,
even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities
is provided.</p>
<p>If Srxlev &gt; S<sub>nonIntraSearchP</sub> and Squal &gt;
S<sub>nonIntraSearchQ</sub> then the UE shall search for inter-frequency
layers of higher priority at least every
T<sub>higher_priority_search</sub> where
T<sub>higher_priority_search</sub> is described in clause 4.2.2.7.</p>
<p>If Srxlev ≤ S<sub>nonIntraSearchP</sub> or Squal ≤
S<sub>nonIntraSearchQ</sub> then the UE shall search for and measure
inter-frequency layers of higher, equal or lower priority in preparation
for possible reselection. In this scenario, the minimum rate at which
the UE is required to search for and measure higher priority layers
shall be the same as that defined below in this clause.</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to evaluate whether a newly detectable
inter-frequency cell meets the reselection criteria defined in TS38.304
[1] within K<sub>carrier</sub> * T<sub>detect,NR_Inter</sub> +
K<sub>carrier_HST</sub> * T<sub>detect,NR_Inter_HST</sub> if at least
carrier frequency information is provided for inter-frequency neighbour
cells by the serving cells when T<sub>reselection</sub> = 0 provided
that the reselection criteria is met by a margin of at least 5 dB in FR1
or 6.5dB in FR2 for reselections based on ranking or 6dB in FR1 or 7.5dB
in FR2 for SS-RSRP reselections based on absolute priorities or 4dB in
FR1 and 4dB in FR2 for SS-RSRQ reselections based on absolute
priorities.</p>
<p>The parameter K<sub>carrier</sub> is the number of NR inter-frequency
carriers which are not configured with
<em>highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17</em> for FR1 indicated by the serving
cell. The parameter K<sub>carrier_HST</sub> is the number of NR
inter-frequency carriers which are configured with
<em>highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17</em> for FR1 indicated by the serving
cell. The parameter K<sub>carrier</sub> for a UE configured with idle
mode CA measurements (while T331 is running), is the combined number of
NR inter-frequency carriers indicated by the serving cell and the number
of NR inter-frequency carriers configured for idle mode CA measurements
which are not configured with <em>highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17</em> for
FR1. The parameter K<sub>carrier_HST</sub> for a UE configured with idle
mode CA measurements (while T331 is running), is the combined number of
NR inter-frequency carriers indicated by the serving cell and the number
of NR inter-frequency carriers configured for idle mode CA measurements
which are configured with <em>highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17</em> for
FR1.</p>
<p>Note: combined total number means that if a carrier is an
inter-frequency carrier indicated by the serving cell for mobility and
additionally a carrier configured for idle mode CA measurements, it only
counts as one carrier.</p>
<p>An inter-frequency cell is considered to be detectable according to
the conditions defined in Annex B.1.3 for a corresponding Band.</p>
<p>When higher priority cells are found by the higher priority search,
they shall be measured at least every T<sub>measure,NR_Inter</sub>. If,
after detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined
that reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to
continuously measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing
possibility of reselection. However, the minimum measurement filtering
requirements specified later in this clause shall still be met by the UE
before it makes any determination that it may stop measuring the cell.
If the UE detects on a NR carrier a cell whose physical identity is
indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control
system information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to
perform measurements on that cell.</p>
<p>The UE shall measure SS-RSRP or SS-RSRQ at least every
K<sub>carrier</sub> * T<sub>measure,NR_Inter</sub> +
K<sub>carrier_HST</sub> * T<sub>measure,NR_Inter_HST</sub> (see table
4.2.2.4-1 and table 4.2.2.4-2 if UE declares support of idle mode
inter-frequency measurement enhancement when configured with
<em>highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17</em> for FR1, otherwise see table
4.2.2.4-1 only) for identified lower or equal priority inter-frequency
cells. If the UE detects on a NR carrier a cell whose physical identity
is indicated as not allowed for that carrier in the measurement control
system information of the serving cell, the UE is not required to
perform measurements on that cell.</p>
<p>The UE shall filter SS-RSRP or SS-RSRQ measurements of each measured
higher, lower and equal priority inter-frequency cell using at least 2
measurements. Within the set of measurements used for the filtering, at
least two measurements shall be spaced by at least
T<sub>measure,NR_Inter</sub>/2 for carriers which are not configured
with <em>highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17</em> for FR1or
T<sub>measure,NR_Inter_HST</sub> /2 for carriers which are configured
with <em>highSpeedMeasInterFreq-r17</em> forFR1.</p>
<p>The UE shall not consider a NR neighbour cell in cell reselection, if
it is indicated as not allowed in the measurement control system
information of the serving cell.</p>
<p>For an inter-frequency cell that has been already detected, but that
has not been reselected to, the filtering shall be such that the UE
shall be capable of evaluating that the inter-frequency cell has met
reselection criterion defined TS 38.304 [1] within K<sub>carrier</sub> *
T<sub>evaluate,NR_Inter</sub> + K<sub>carrier_HST</sub> *
T<sub>evaluate,NR_Inter_HST</sub> when T<sub>reselection</sub> = 0 as

<p>- the cell has the highest number of beams above the threshold
<em>absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation</em> among all detected cells whose
cell-ranking criterion R value in TS38.304 [1] is within
<em>rangeToBestCell</em> of the cell-ranking criterion R value of the
highest ranked cell.</p>
<p>- if there are multiple such cells, the cell has the highest rank
among them</p>
<p>- the cell is at least 5dB better ranked in FR1 or 6.5dB better
ranked in FR2 if the current serving cell is among them. or</p>
<p>- 6dB in FR1 or 7.5dB in FR2 for SS-RSRP reselections based on
absolute priorities or</p>
<p>- 4dB in FR1 or 4dB in FR2 for SS-RSRQ reselections based on absolute
priorities.</p>
<p>When evaluating cells for reselection, the SSB side conditions apply
to both serving and inter-frequency cells.</p>
<p>If T<sub>reselection</sub> timer has a non zero value and the
inter-frequency cell is satisfied with the reselection criteria, the UE
shall evaluate this inter-frequency cell for the T<sub>reselection</sub>
time. If this cell remains satisfied with the reselection criteria
within this duration, then the UE shall reselect that cell.</p>
<p>The UE is not expected to meet the measurement requirements for an
inter-frequency carrier under DRX cycle=320 ms defined in Table
4.2.2.4-1 and Table 4.2.2.4-2 under the following conditions:</p>
<p>- T<sub>SMTC_intra</sub> = T<sub>SMTC_inter</sub> = 160 ms; where</p>
<p>- TSMTC_intra is the periodicity of the SMTC configured for the
intra-frequency carrier if no identified intra-frequency cell is in the

periodicity of the smtc2-LP configured for the intra-frequency carrier
if at least one identified intra-frequency cell is in the PCI list of
smtc2-LP on this intra-frequency carrier. During PSS/SSS detection, the
periodicity of the SMTC configured for the intra-frequency carrier is
assumed for TSMTC_intra. If the actual SSB transmission periodicity is
greater than the SMTC configured for the intra-frequency carrier, longer
Tdetect, NR_intra is expected.</p>
<p>- TSMTC_inter is the actual SMTC periodicity used by the
inter-frequency cell being identified. During PSS/SSS detection, the
periodicity of the SMTC configured for the inter-frequency carrier is
assumed for TSMTC_inter. If the actual SSB transmission periodicity is
greater than the SMTC configured for the inter-frequency carrier, longer
Tdetect, NR_inter is expected.</p>
<p>- SMTC occasions configured for the inter-frequency carrier occur up
to 1 ms before the start or up to 1 ms after the end of the SMTC
occasions configured for the intra-frequency carrier, and</p>
<p>- SMTC occasions configured for the intra-frequency carrier and for
the inter-frequency carrier occur up to 1 ms before the start or up to 1

inter-frequency cells the serving cell may not provide explicit
neighbour list but carrier frequency information and bandwidth
information only. UE measurement activity is also controlled by
measurement rules defined in TS 38.304, allowing the UE to limit its
measurement activity.</p>

[1] within T<sub>detect,NR_Intra_RedCap</sub> when that Treselection= 0
. An intra frequency cell is considered to be detectable according to
the conditions defined in Annex B.1.4 for a corresponding Band.</p>
<p>The UE shall measure SS-RSRP and SS-RSRQ at least every
T<sub>measure,NR_Intra_RedCap</sub> for intra-frequency cells that are
identified and measured according to the measurement rules.</p>
<p>The UE shall filter SS-RSRP and SS-RSRQ measurements of each measured
intra-frequency cell using at least 2 measurements. Within the set of

<em>absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation</em> among all detected cells whose
cell-ranking criterion R value in TS 38.304 [1] is within
<em>rangeToBestCell</em> of the cell-ranking criterion R value of the
highest ranked cell.</p>
<p>- if there are multiple such cells, the cell has the highest rank

Measurements of inter-frequency NR cells for RedCap UE</h4>
<p>The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and
perform SS-RSRP or SS-RSRQ measurements of identified inter-frequency
cells if carrier frequency information is provided by the serving cell,
even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell identities
is provided.</p>
<p>If Srxlev &gt; S<sub>nonIntraSearchP</sub> and Squal &gt;
S<sub>nonIntraSearchQ</sub> then the UE shall search for inter-frequency
layers of higher priority at least every
T<sub>higher_priority_search</sub> where
T<sub>higher_priority_search</sub> is described in clause 4.2.2.7.</p>
<p>If Srxlev ≤ S<sub>nonIntraSearchP</sub> or Squal ≤
S<sub>nonIntraSearchQ</sub> then the UE shall search for and measure
inter-frequency layers of higher, equal or lower priority in preparation
for possible reselection. In this scenario, the minimum rate at which
the UE is required to search for and measure higher priority layers
shall be the same as that defined below in this clause.</p>

<p>5 dB in FR1 or 6.5 dB in FR2 for reselections based on ranking or</p>

<p>The parameter K<sub>carrier_RedCap</sub> is the number of NR

inter-frequency cell is considered to be detectable according to the
conditions defined in Annex B.1.5 for a corresponding Band. When higher
priority cells are found by the higher priority search, they shall be
measured at least every T<sub>measure,NR_Inter_RedCap</sub>. If, after
detecting a cell in a higher priority search, it is determined that
reselection has not occurred then the UE is not required to continuously
measure the detected cell to evaluate the ongoing possibility of
reselection. However, the minimum measurement filtering requirements
specified later in this clause shall still be met by the UE before it
makes any determination that it may stop measuring the cell. If the UE

measurement reporting delay excludes all of the following:</p>
<p>- additional delay caused other LPP signalling on the DCCH,</p>
<p>- delay uncertainty introduced when inserting the measurement report
in the TTI of the uplink DCCH, equal to 2 x TTI<sub>DCCH</sub> where
TTI<sub>DCCH</sub> is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot when
the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or slot

<p>- any delay caused by unavailability of UL resources to transmit the
measurement report,</p>
<p>- any transmission delay needed by SDT,</p>

<p>T<sub>processing</sub> is time for UE processing.
T<sub>processing</sub> can be up to 20ms.</p>
<p>T<sub>margin</sub> is time for SSB post-processing.
T<sub>margin</sub> can be up to 2ms.</p>
<p>T<sub>IU</sub> is the interruption uncertainty in acquiring the first

the summation of SSB to PRACH occasion association period and 10 ms. SSB
to PRACH occasion associated period is defined in the table 8.1-1 of TS

<p>The interruption time is the time between the end of the last TTI

<p>6.1.4.2.2 Measurement time</p>
<p>The measurement time delay is defined from the end of

still be based on non-DRX target cell search times.</p>
<p>- T<sub>rs</sub> is the SMTC periodicity of the target NR cell if the
UE has been provided with an SMTC configuration for the target cellin
the handover command, otherwise,</p>
<p>- T<sub>rs</sub> is the SMTC configured in the measObjectNR having
the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing as NCD-SSB indicated by
nonCellDefiningSSB-r17 if the first active DL BWP included in handover
command is configured with nonCellDefiningSSB-r17, otherwise, as CD-SSB
indicated by absoluteFrequencySSB in frequencyInfoDL in handover
command.</p>
<p>- If the measObjectNRs having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier
spacing configured by MN and SN have different SMTC, Trs is the
periodicity of one of the SMTC which is up to UE implementation. If the
UE is not provided SMTC configuration or measurement object on this
frequency, the requirement in this clause is applied with
T<sub>rs</sub>=5ms assuming the SSB transmission periodicity is 5ms.
There is no requirement if the SSB transmission periodicity is not 5ms.
If the UE has been provided with higher layer in TS 38.331 [2] signaling
of <em>smtc2</em> prior to the handover command, T<sub>rs</sub> follows

<p>The time delay (T<sub>connection_release_redirect_NR</sub>) is the
time between the end of the last slot containing the RRC command,
“<em>RRCRelease</em>” (TS 38.331 [2]) on the NR PDSCH and the time the
UE starts to send random access to the target NR cell. The time delay

<p>- the conditions of SSB_RP and SSB Ês/Iot according to Annex B.2.5
for a corresponding NR Band are fulfilled.</p>
<p>- T<sub>RRC_procedure_delay</sub>: It is the RRC procedure delay for
processing the received message “<em>RRCRelease</em>” as defined in
clause 6.2.2 of TS 38.331 [2].</p>
<p>- T<sub>identify-NR</sub>: It is the time to identify the target NR
cell and depends on the FR of the target NR cell. It is defined in Table
6.2C.3.2.1-1. Note that T<sub>identify-NR</sub> =

<p>The UE shall have capability to follow the frame timing change of the
reference cell in connected state or when transmiting PUSCH on CG
resources for SDT in RRC_Inactive. The uplink frame transmission takes
place <img src="media/image8.svg" /> before the reception of the first
detected path (in time) of the corresponding downlink frame from the
reference cell. For serving cell(s) in pTAG, UE shall use the SpCell as
the reference cell for deriving the UE transmit timing for cells in the
pTAG. For serving cell(s) in sTAG, UE shall use any of the activated
SCells as the reference cell for deriving the UE transmit timing for the
cells in the sTAG. UE initial transmit timing accuracy and gradual
timing adjustment requirements are defined in the following
requirements.</p>
<p>In the requirements of clause 7.1.2, the term reference cell on a
carrier frequency subject to CCA is not available at the UE refers to
when at least one SSB is configured by gNB, but the first two successive
candidate SSB positions for the same SSB index within the discovery
burst transmission window are not available during at least one
discovery burst transmission window, at the UE due to DL CCA failures at
gNB during the last 1280 ms; otherwise the reference cell on the carrier
frequency subject to CCA is considered as available at the UE.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-4">7.1.2 Requirements</h3>
<p>The UE initial transmission timing error shall be less than or equal
to ±T<sub>e</sub> where the timing error limit value T<sub>e</sub> is
specified in Table 7.1.2-1. This requirement applies:</p>
<p>- when it is the first transmission in a DRX cycle for PUCCH, PUSCH
and SRS, or it is the PRACH transmission, or it is the msgA
transmission, or it is the first transmission sent on the PSCell for
activating the deactivated SCG without RACH.</p>
<p>- when it is the transmission for PUSCH on CG resources for SDT in
RRC_Inactive.</p>
<p>When the UL SCS is 120 kHz or smaller, the UE shall meet the Te
requirement for an initial transmission provided that at least one SSB
is available at the UE during the last 160 ms. When the UL SCS is 480
kHz the UE shall meet the Te requirement for an initial transmission
provided that at least one SSB is available in the last 80 ms. When the
UL SCS is 960 kHz the UE shall meet the Te requirement for an initial
transmission provided that at least one SSB is available in the last 40
ms. The reference point for the UE initial transmit timing control
requirement shall be the downlink timing of the reference cell minus
<img src="media/image9.svg" style="width:1.25in;height:0.20833in" />.
The downlink timing is defined as the time when the first path (in time)
of the corresponding downlink frame used by the UE to determine downlink
timing is received from the reference cell at the UE antenna.
<em>N</em><sub>TA</sub> for PRACH is defined as 0.</p>
<p><img src="media/image9.svg"
