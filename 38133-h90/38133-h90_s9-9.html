requirement</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">9.1.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>This clause contains general requirements on the UE regarding
measurement reporting in RRC_CONNECTED state. The requirements are split
in intra-frequency, inter-frequency, inter-RAT E-UTRAN FDD, inter-RAT
E-UTRAN TDD, and L1-RSRP measurements requirements. These measurements
may be used by the NG-RAN. The measurement quantities are defined in
TS38.215 [4], the measurement model is defined in TS38.300 [10],
TS37.340 [17] and measurement accuracies are specified in clause 10.
Control of measurement reporting is specified in TS 38.331 [2].</p>
<p>In the requirements of clause 9, the exceptions for side conditions

Capabilities for Support of Event Triggering and Reporting Criteria</h3>
<h4 id="introduction-1">9.1.4.1 Introduction</h4>
<p>This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of
event triggering and reporting criteria. As long as the measurement
configuration does not exceed the requirements stated in clause 9.1.4.2,
the UE shall meet all other performance requirements defined in clause 9
and clause 10. The requirements in this clause also apply for a UE in
EN-DC with PSCell on a carrier frequency with CCA or SA NR with PCell on
a carrier frequency with CCA.</p>
<p>The UE can be requested to make measurements under different
measurement identities defined in TS 38.331 [2]. Each measurement
identity corresponds to either event-based reporting, periodic
reporting, or no reporting. In case of event-based reporting, each
measurement identity is associated with an event triggering criterion.
In case of periodic reporting, a measurement identity is associated with
one periodic reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a measurement
identity is associated with one no reporting criterion.</p>
<p>The purpose of this clause is to set some limits on the number of
different event triggering, periodic, and no reporting criteria the UE
may be requested to track in parallel.</p>
<h4 id="requirements">9.1.4.2 Requirements</h4>
<p>In this clause a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event
(in the case of event-based reporting), or one periodic reporting
criterion (in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion
(in case of no reporting). For event-based reporting, each instance of
event, with the same or different event identities, is counted as
separate reporting criterion in Table 9.1.4.2-1.</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to
E<sub>cat</sub> reporting criteria according to Table 9.1.4.2-1. For the
measurement categories belonging to intra-frequency, inter-frequency,
and inter-RAT measurements (i.e. without counting other categories that
the UE shall always support in parallel), the UE need not support more
than the total number of reporting criteria as follows:</p>
<p>- For UE configured with EN-DC: <span class="math inline">\(E_{cat,EN

<p><img src="media/image7.svg" /> is the total number of NR reporting
criteria according to Table 9.1.4.2-1, and n is the number of configured

EN-DC mode: carrier-specific scaling factor for SSB, CSI-RS-based L3
measurements and RSSI and channel occupancy measurements performed
within gaps</h5>
<p>The scaling value CSSF<sub>within_gap,i</sub> below has been derived
without considering GSM inter-RAT carriers.</p>
<p>When one or more measurement objects are monitored within measurement
gaps, the carrier specific scaling factor for a target measurement
object with index <em>i</em> is designated as
CSSF<sub>within_gap,i</sub> and is derived as described in this
clause.</p>
<p>For UE supporting per-FR gap, for each measurement object <em>i</em>
that are measured based on effective MGRP as defined in clause 9.1.2,
CSSF<sub>within_gap,i</sub> used for derving the measurement
requirements is defined as 2*N<sub>with_CSI-RS</sub> +
N<sub>SSB_only</sub>, where</p>
<p>- N<sub>with_CSI-RS</sub> is the number of measurement objects with
either both SSB and CSI-RS based L3 configured or only CSI-RS based L3
measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object <em>i</em>,
and</p>
<p>- N<sub>SSB_only</sub> is the number of measurement objects with only
SSB based L3 measurement configured in the same FR as measurement object
<em>i</em>.</p>
<p>For a UE in E-UTRA-NR dual connectivity operation, if a SSB-based
measurement object configured by PSCell and an NR SSB-based inter-RAT
measurement object configured by E-UTRAN PCell are on the same carrier,
they shall be counted as one measurement object in M<sub>tot,i,j</sub>,
provided that they meet the measurement object merging conditions [in

<p>If measurement object <em>i</em> refers to an RSTD measurement with
periodicity Tprs&gt;160ms or with periodicity Tprs=160ms but
<em>prs-MutingInfo-r9</em> is configured, CSSF<sub>within_gap,i</sub>=1.
Otherwise, the CSSF<sub>within_gap,i</sub> for other measurement objects
(including RSTD measurement with periodicity Tprs=160ms) participate in

<h4 id="introduction-4">9.1.9.1 Introduction</h4>
<p>The UE capable of network controlled small gap (NCSG) pattern can be
configured with a NCSG pattern via RRC signalling [2].</p>
<p>This clause contains the general requirements on the UE regarding to
Network Controlled Small Gap (NCSG).</p>
<p>The requirements in this clause are applicable for UE configured with
SA NR (with single carrier or NR CA) operation mode.</p>
<p>It is up to UE implementation whether or not the UE is able to
conduct transmission in the following slot(s),</p>
<p>- when <em>mgta</em> is not applied, in the L consecutive UL slots
with respect to the SCS of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as
the DL slots occurring immediately after the last each of the
interrupted slots after VIL1 and VIL2.</p>
<p>- when <em>mgta</em> is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is
other than 15kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS
of the UL carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring
immediately after the last each of the interrupted slots after VIL1 and
VIL2.</p>
<p>- when <em>mgta</em> is applied and the SCS of the UL carrier is
15kHz, in the L consecutive UL slots with respect to the SCS of the UL
carrier with the same slot indices as the DL slots occurring immediately
after the slot partially overlapped with each of the interrupted slots
after VIL1 and VIL2.</p>
<p>where UL slot denotes that all the symbols in the slot are uplink
symbols, and L=1 if <img src="media/image5.svg" /> for the UL
transmission is less than the length of one slot; L=2 otherwise.</p>
<p>Note: Network is supposed to take into account the possible
difference between the estimated TA at network and actual TA at UE when
scheduling UE in the above slot(s).</p>
<p>The interruptions of NCSG in number of slots are listed in Table
9.1.9-1 on all serving cells when per-UE NCSG is configured or on FR1
serving cells when per-FR FR1 NCSG is configured to
<em>ncsg-MeasGapPerFR-r17</em> capable UE. In case that the UE capable
of <em>ncsg-MeasGapPerFR-r17</em> is configured with per-FR FR2 NCSG,
numbers of interrupted slots on FR2 serving cells are listed in Table
9.1.9-2. There are two interruptions in each NCSG occasion, VIL1 before
ML and VIL2 after ML, in NR standalone (with single carrier or NR CA).
Each of them has number of interrupted slots captured in Table 9.1.9-1
and Table 9.1.9-2.</p>

applicability</h4>
<p>Requirements in clause 9.1.9 apply for UE capable of NCSG in
standalone NR in both FR1 and FR2 (including FR1+FR2 CA), provided UE is
configured with only NCSG and no other measurement gap is configured,
and UE is configured with</p>
<p>SSB based intra-frequency measurement (including measurement on
de-activated SCC and measurement on dormant SCell), and/or</p>
<p>SSB based inter-frequency measurement, and/or</p>
<p>Inter-RAT E-UTRAN measurement.</p>
<p>Requirements in clause 9.1.9 do not apply if UE is configured
with</p>
<p>Inter-RAT GSM measurement, or</p>
<p>Inter-RAT UTRAN measurement, or</p>
<p>PRS measurement.</p>
<p>9.1.9.3 Requirements</p>
<p>The UE shall support NCSG patterns defined in Table 9.1.9.3-1 that
are relevant to the UE’s measurement capabilities. ML is the measurement
length. During the VIL1 and VIL2, the UE is not expected to transmit and
receive any data. Where, VIL1 is the visible interruption length before
the ML and VIL2 is the visible interruption length after the ML. During
ML, whether the UE is expected to transmit and receive data on the
corresponding serving carrier(s) depends on the scheduling restriction
requirements specified in clauses 9.2.7.3 and 9.3.10.3. The NCSG
configuration parameters VIL1, ML, VIL2 and VIRP are illustrated in
Figure 9.1.9.3-1. The applicability of the NCSG patterns in Table
9.1.9.3-1 is specified in Table 9.1.9.3-2.</p>

<p>This clause contains requirements on UE capabilities for support of

defined in clause 9 and clause 10.</p>
<p>The UE can be requested to make measurements under different
measurement identities defined in TS 38.331 [2]. Each measurement
identity corresponds to either event-based reporting, periodic
reporting, or no reporting. In case of event-based reporting, each
measurement identity is associated with an event triggering criterion.
In case of periodic reporting, a measurement identity is associated with
one periodic reporting criterion. In case of no reporting, a measurement
identity is associated with one no reporting criterion.</p>
<p>The purpose of this clause is to set some limits on the number of
different event triggering, periodic, and no reporting criteria the UE
may be requested to track in parallel.</p>
<h4 id="a.4.2-requirements">9.1A.4.2 Requirements</h4>
<p>In this clause a reporting criterion corresponds to either one event
(in the case of event-based reporting), or one periodic reporting
criterion (in case of periodic reporting), or one no reporting criterion
(in case of no reporting). For event-based reporting, each instance of
event, with the same or different event identities, is counted as
separate reporting criterion in Table 9.1A.4.2-1.</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to support in parallel per category up to
E<sub>cat</sub> reporting criteria according to Table [9.1A.4.2-1]. For
the measurement categories belonging to intra-frequency,
inter-frequency, and inter-RAT measurements (i.e. without counting other
categories that the UE shall always support in parallel), the UE need
not support more than the total number of reporting criteria as

<p>Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in periodic
measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses 10.1.2.1
(RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for FR1),
10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and 10.1.13.1

<h4 id="event-triggered-periodic-reporting">9.2.4.2 Event-triggered
Periodic Reporting</h4>
<p>Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
event-triggered periodic measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1
(RSRQ for FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and
10.1.13.1 (RS-SINR for FR2).</p>
<p>The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2.4.3.</p>
<h4 id="event-triggered-reporting">9.2.4.3 Event Triggered
Reporting</h4>
<p>Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in event
triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements in clauses
10.1.2.1 (RSRP for FR1), 10.1.3.1 (RSRP for FR2), 10.1.7.1 (RSRQ for
FR1), 10.1.8.1 (RSRQ for FR2), 10.1.12.1 (RS-SINR for FR1) and 10.1.13.1
(RS-SINR for FR2).</p>
<p>The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long
as no reporting criteria is fulfilled.</p>
<p>The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an
event that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE
starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI<sub>DCCH</sub>. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources being available for UE to send the
measurement report on.</p>
<p>The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T<sub>identify intra with index</sub> or T
<sub>identify intra without index</sub> defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or
clause 9.2.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional delay can be
expected. In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to
perform E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be
expected in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional
delay can be expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of
per-FR gap.</p>
<p>A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period
T<sub>identify_intra_without_index</sub> or
T<sub>identify_intra_with_index</sub> as defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or
clause 9.2.6.2. If a cell which has been detectable at least for the
time period T<sub>identify intra without index</sub> or T<sub>identify
intra with index</sub> defined in clause 9.2.5.1 or clause 9.2.6.2
becomes undetectable for a period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes
detectable again with the same spatial reception parameter and triggers
an event, the event triggered measurement reporting delay shall be less
than T<sub>SSB_measurement_period_intra</sub> provided the timing to
that cell has not changed more than ± 3200/<span
class="math inline">\(2^{µ}\)</span> T<sub>c</sub> while the measurement
gap has not been available and L3 filtering has not been used, where
<em>µ</em> is the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS
38.211 [3]. When L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be
expected. In EN-DC and NE-DC operation, when the UE is configured to
perform E-UTRA SRS carrier-based switching an additional delay can be
expected in FR1 if the UE is capable of per-FR gap, or an additional
delay can be expected in both FR1 and FR2 if the UE is not capable of
per-FR gap.</p>

<p> For a UE that supports Pre-MG, an SMTC occasion is only considered
to be overlapped by Pre-MG if the Pre-MG is activated.</p>
<p>if the high layer in TS 38.331 [2] signalling of <em>smtc2</em> is

Otherwise the assumed periodicity of intra-frequency SMTC occasions

<p>When UE supports <em>concurrentMeasGap-r17</em> and is configured
with concurrent measurement gaps,</p>
<p>K<sub>p</sub> is the scaling factor for an SSB frequency layer to be
measured without measurement gaps. K<sub>p</sub> = N<sub>total</sub> /
N<sub>available</sub>, where N<sub>available</sub> and N<sub>total</sub>
are calculated as follows:</p>
<p>- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period<sub>,</sub> MGRP_max),
where MGRP max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE
measurement gap and/or per-FR measurement gap within the same FR as the
SSB frequency layer, and starting from the beginning of any SMTC
occasion:</p>
<p>- N<sub>total</sub> is the total number of SMTC occasions within the
window, including those overlapped with measurement gap occasions within
the window, and</p>
<p>- N<sub>available</sub> is the number of SMTC occasions that are not
overlapped with any non-dropped MG occasion within the window W, after
accounting for measurement gap collisions by applying the measurement
gap collision rule in section 9.1.8.3.</p>
<p>K<sub>p</sub> = 1 when N<sub>available</sub> = 0.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Otherwise, when UE is not configured with or UE does not support
concurrent measurement gaps:</p>
<p>When intra-frequency SMTC is fully non overlapping with measurement
gaps or NCSG, or intra-frequency SMTC is fully overlapping with MGs or
NCSG, Kp=1</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, Kp = 1/(1- (SMTC period /MGRP)), where SMTC period &lt; MGRP. When
intra-frequency SMTC is partially overlapping with NCSG, Kp = 1/(1-
(SMTC period /VIRP)), where SMTC period &lt; VIRP. For calculation of
Kp, if the high layer signalling (TS 38.331 [2]) of <em>smtc2</em> is
configured, for cells indicated in the <em>pci-List</em> parameter in
<em>smtc2</em>, the SMTC periodicity corresponds to the value of higher
layer parameter <em>smtc2</em>; for the other cells, the SMTC
periodicity corresponds to the value of higher layer parameter
<em>smtc1.</em> If the higher layer signaling in TS38.331 [2] signalling
of <em>smtc2</em> is present and smtc1 is fully overlapping with
measurement gaps and smtc2 is partially overlapping with measurement
gaps, requirements are not specified for
T<sub>identify_intra_without_index</sub> or
T<sub>identify_intra_with_index</sub></p>
<p>For FR2,</p>
<p>K<sub>layer1_measurement</sub>=1,</p>
<p>- if all of the reference signals configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap are not fully overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC
occasions, or</p>
<p>- if all of the reference signal configured for RLM, BFD, CBD or
L1-RSRP for beam reporting on any FR2 serving frequency in the same band
outside measurement gap and fully-overlapped by intra-frequency SMTC
occasions are not overlapped with any of the SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol before each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, and 1 symbol after each consecutive SSB symbols and the RSSI
symbols, given that <em>SSB-ToMeasure</em> and
<em>SS-RSSI-Measurement</em> are configured, where SSB symbols are
indicated by the union set of SSB-ToMeasure from all the configured
measurement objects on the same serving carrier which can be merged. and
RSSI symbols are indicated by <em>SS-RSSI-Measurement</em>;</p>
<p>K<sub>layer1_measurement</sub>=1.5, otherwise.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned reference signal configured for L1-RSRP
measurement is aperiodic CSI-RS resource, longer cell identification
delay would be expected.</p>

Table 9.2.5.1-2, Table 9.2.5.1-3, Table 9.2.5.1-4, Table 9.2.5.1-5 and
Table 9.2.5.1-6 shall depend on the MCG DRX cycle. If SCG DRX is in use,

<h2 id="a-nr-intra-frequency-measurements-with-cca">9.2A NR
intra-frequency measurements with CCA</h2>
<h3 id="a.1-introduction-1">9.2A.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The requirements in clause 9.2.A apply for intra-frequency
measurements on carrier frequency with CCA.</p>
<p>When the intra-frequency measurement is performed on a neighbour cell
in FR2-2 with shared spectrum channel access, UE shall determine the CCA
mode of the neighbour cell according to
<em>channelAccessMode2-r17</em>of the cell configured in
<em>MeasObjectNR</em>. If <em>channelAccessMode2-r17</em> of the cell is
enabled, UE shall assume that CCA applies to the cell and perform
measurement accordingly, and the requirements in clause 9.2A shall
apply; otherwise, UE shall assume that CCA does not apply to the cell
and perform measurement accordingly, and requirements in 9.2 shall
apply.</p>
<p>A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and
perform SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified
intra-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell or the PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical
layer cell identities is provided.</p>
<p>The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if</p>
<p>- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or</p>
<p>- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP[3].</p>
<p>For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps,
UE may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2A.5.3.</p>
<p>SSB based measurements are configured along with one or two
measurement timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides
periodicity, duration and offset information on a window of up to 5ms
where the measurements are to be performed. For intra-frequency
connected mode measurements, up to two measurement window periodicities
may be configured. A single measurement window offset and measurement
duration are configured per intra-frequency measurement object.</p>
<p>When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect
SSB which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB which end later than the gap end – switching time. Switching
time is 0.5ms for frequency range FR1 and 0.25 ms for frequency range
FR2-2.</p>
<p>In the requirements of clause 9.2A, the term SMTC occasion not
available at the UE refers to when the SMTC contains SSBs configured by
gNB in a cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but
<em>N<sub>SSB</sub></em> candidate SSB positions for the same SSB index
within the discovery burst transmission window are not available at the
UE due to DL CCA failures at gNB during the corresponding period,
where:</p>
<p>- For the cell detection procedure: <em>N<sub>SSB</sub></em> is at
least one candidate SSB position (NOTE: the one candidate SSB position
for the cell detection shall not be impacted by the set of candidate SSB
positions which are already being measured by the UE within the current
measurement period of the on-going measurements), and</p>
<p>- For other procedures in clause 9.2A: <em>N<sub>SSB</sub></em> are
the first two successive candidate SSB positions when two or more
candidate SSB positions are configured for this SSB index in one
discovery burst transmission window, otherwise <em>N<sub>SSB</sub></em>
is one candidate SSB position;</p>
<p>otherwise the SMTC occasion is considered as available at the UE.</p>
<p>For the FR2-2 requirements of clause 9.2A, an SMTC occasion group
consists of N consecutive SMTC occasions, where N is the UE Rx beam
sweeping scaling factor. An SMTC occasion group is not available, when
at least one SMTC occasion in the group is not transmitted by the
gNB.</p>
<h3 id="a.2-requirements-applicability">9.2A.2 Requirements

<p>The requirements in clause 9.2A apply, provided:</p>
<p>- The cell being identified or measured is detectable.</p>
<p>An intra-frequency cell shall be considered detectable when for each
relevant SSB:</p>
<p>- SS-RSRP related side conditions given in clause 10.1.27 and TBD for
FR1 and FR2-2, respectively, for a corresponding Band,</p>
<p>- SS-RSRQ related side conditions given in clause 10.1.29 and TBD for

Reporting Requirements</h3>
<p>9.2A.4.1 Periodic Reporting</p>
<p>Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1. 36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2),10.1.29(RSRQ
for FR1), TBD (RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD
(RS-SINR for FR2-2), respectively.</p>
<p>9.2A.4.2 Event-triggered Periodic Reporting</p>
<p>Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2), 10.1.29 (RSRQ
for FR1), TBD (RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD
(RS-SINR for FR2-2) , respectively.</p>
<p>The first report in event triggered periodic measurement reporting
shall meet the requirements specified in clause 9.2A.4.3.</p>
<p>9.2A.4.3 Event Triggered Reporting</p>
<p>Reported RSRP, RSRQ, and RS-SINR measurements contained in
periodically triggered measurement reports shall meet the requirements
in clauses 10.1.36 (RSRP for FR1), TBD (RSRP for FR2-2), 10.1.29 (RSRQ
for FR1), TBD (RSRQ for FR2-2), 10.1.31 (RS-SINR for FR1) and TBD
(RS-SINR for FR2-2), respectively.</p>
<p>The UE shall not send any event triggered measurement reports as long
as no reporting criteria is fulfilled.</p>
<p>The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an
event that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE
starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x
TTI<sub>DCCH</sub>. This measurement reporting delay excludes a delay
which caused by no UL resources being available for UE to send the
measurement report on, and all delays due to UL CCA failures until the
successful transmission of the report.</p>
<p>The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T <sub>identify intra with index_CCA</sub>
or T <sub>identify intra without index_CCA</sub> defined in clause
9.2A.5.1 or clause 9.2A.6.2. When L3 filtering is used an additional
delay can be expected.</p>
<p>A cell is detectable only if at least one SSBs measured from the Cell
being configured remains detectable during the time period T
<sub>identify_intra_without_index_CCA</sub> or T
<sub>identify_intra_with_index_CCA</sub> as defined in clause 9.2A.5.1
or clause 9.2A.6.2. If a cell which has been detectable at least for the
time period T <sub>identify intra without index_CCA</sub> or T
<sub>identify intra with index_CCA</sub> defined in clause 9.2A.5.1 or
clause 9.2A.6.2 becomes undetectable for a period≤ 8 seconds and then
the cell becomes detectable again with the same spatial reception
parameter and triggers an event, the event triggered measurement
reporting delay shall be less than
T<sub>SSB_measurement_period_intra_CCA</sub> provided the timing to that
cell has not changed more than ± 3200/<span
class="math inline">\(2^{µ}\)</span> Tc while the measurement gap has
not been available and the L3 filter has not been used, where <em>µ</em>
is the SCS configuration as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 38.211 [3]. When
L3 filtering is used, an additional delay can be expected.</p>

intra-frequency measurements for RedCap</h2>
<h3 id="b.1-introduction">9.2B.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the reference SSB of the serving cell
and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour cell are the same,
and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also the same. The
reference SSB is the SSB defined in BWP-specific <em>servingCellMO</em>
under <em>BWP-DownlinkDedicated</em> of active DL BWP. If the field is
absent, the reference SSB is the SSB defined in <em>servingCellMO</em>
under <em>ServingCellConfig</em> [2].</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and
perform SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified
intra-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell
identities is provided.</p>
<p>The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if</p>
<p>- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or</p>
<p>- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP [3].</p>
<p>For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps,
UE may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2B.5.3.</p>
<p>SSB based measurements are configured along with one or two
measurement timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides
periodicity, duration and offset information on a window of up to 5ms
where the measurements are to be performed. For intra-frequency
connected mode measurements, up to two measurement window periodicities
may be configured. A single measurement window offset and measurement
duration are configured per intra-frequency measurement object.</p>
<p>When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect
SSB which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB which end later than the gap end – switching time. Switching
time is 0.5ms for frequency range FR1 and 0.25ms for frequency range
FR2.</p>

RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the

<p>The requirements in clause 9.2C apply for intra-frequency
measurements on an SAN carrier frequency. The requirements apply
provided that valid parameters of ephemeris information, epoch time of
the ephemeris, common TA, validity timer information, downlink
polarization information for target NR SAN cell are send to UE.</p>
<p>A measurement is defined as a SSB based intra-frequency measurement
provided the centre frequency of the SSB of the serving cell indicated
for measurement and the centre frequency of the SSB of the neighbour
cell are the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs are also
the same.</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to identify new intra-frequency cells and
perform SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified
intra-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell
identities is provided.</p>
<p>The UE can perform intra-frequency SSB based measurements without
measurement gaps if</p>
<p>- the UE indicates ‘no-gap’ via <em>intraFreq-needForGap</em> for
intra-frequency measurement, or</p>
<p>- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE, or</p>
<p>- the active downlink BWP is initial BWP[3].</p>
<p>For intra-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps,
UE may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.2C.5.3.</p>
<p>SSB based measurements are configured along with one or more
measurement timing configuration(s) (SMTC(s)) which provides
periodicity, duration and offset information on a window of up to 5ms
where the measurements are to be performed. For intra-frequency
connected mode measurements,</p>
<p>- when <em>SSB-MTC4List-r17</em> is not configured, up to two
measurement window periodicities may be configured with <em>SSB-MTC</em>
and <em>SSB-MTC2</em></p>

<h3 id="introduction-7">9.3.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2.</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and
perform SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified
inter-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell or PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer
cell identities is provided.</p>
<p>A measurement is defined as an inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps (either legacy measurement gap or NCSG) in
active BWP and its delay requirements are specified in clause 9.3.9, for
UE capable of <em>interFrequencyMeas-NoGap</em> provided that</p>
<p>- the UE supports <em>interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16</em> [15], and</p>
<p>- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.</p>
<p>For UE supporting <em>nr-NeedForGapNCSG-reporting-r17</em> and
indicating <em>NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR</em> for inter-frequency
measurement,</p>
<p>- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement
without gap if</p>
<p>- the UE indicates ‘nogap-noncsg’ via <em>NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR</em>
for the inter-frequency measurement, and</p>
<p>- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE</p>
<p>The delay requirements are specified in clause 9.3.9.</p>
<p>- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with
NCSG if</p>
<p>- the UE indicates ‘ncsg’ via <em>NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR</em> for the
inter-frequency measurement, and</p>
<p>- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE</p>
<p>When network configures NCSG, the delay requirements are specified in
clause 9.3.10.</p>
<p>When network configures measurement gap, the delay requirements are
specified in clauses 9.3.4 and 9.3.5.</p>
<p>- An inter-frequency SSB measurement is defined as measurement with
gap if</p>
<p>- the UE indicates ‘gap’ via <em>NeedForGapNCSG-InfoNR</em> for the
inter-frequency measurement, and</p>
<p>- the SSB is not completely contained in the active BWP of the UE</p>
<p>When network configures measurement gap, the delay requirements are
specified in clauses 9.3.4 and 9.3.5.</p>
<p>- For inter-frequency SSB based measurements with NCSG, UE may cause
scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.10.3.</p>
<p>For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps,
UE may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause 9.3.5.3.</p>
<p>Note: Non-CA capable UE is not expected to indicate support of
<em>interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16</em> [15].</p>
<p>SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement
object.</p>
<p>When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect
SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ on an inter-frequency measurement object
which start earlier than the gap starting time + switching time, nor
detect SSB and measure RSSI of RSRQ which ends later than the gap end –
switching time. When the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-FR
gap is configured to the UE in EN-DC, SA NR, NE-DC and NR-DC, or the
serving cells are in FR2, the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the
per-UE gap is configured to the UE in SA NR and NR-DC, the switching
time is 0.25ms. Otherwise the switching time is 0.5ms.</p>
<p>The requirements in this clause shall also apply, when the UE is
configured to perform SRS carrier based switching and using measurement
gaps.</p>
<p>Longer measurement period would be expected during the period
T<sub>identify_CGI</sub> when the UE is requested to decode an NR
CGI.</p>
<h3 id="requirements-applicability-3">9.3.2 Requirements

where N<sub>available</sub> and N<sub>total</sub> are calculated as
follows:</p>
<p>- For a window W of duration max(SMTC period<sub>,</sub> MGRP_max),
where MGRP_max is the maximum MGRP across all configured per-UE
measurement gap(s) and per-FR measurement gap(s) within the same FR, and

<p>- N<sub>total</sub> is the total number of SMTC occasions that are
covered by instances of the associated measurement gap within the window
W, including those dropped and non-dropped instances of the associated

<p>- N<sub>available</sub> is the number of SMTC occasions that are
covered by instances of the non-dropped associated measurement gap
within the window W, after accounting for collisions between the
measurement gaps by applying the measurement gap collision rule in
section 9.1.8.3.</p>

<p>The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an

requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the

Inter-frequency SFTD measurement requirements</h3>
<h4 id="introduction-8">9.3.8.1 Introduction</h4>
<p>This clause contains requirements for a UE supporting NR
inter-frequency SFTD measurement and is applicable in RRC_CONNECTED
state. The UE shall, depending on network request, perform
inter-frequency SFTD measurement and report SFTD result with or without
SS-RSRP. The overall delay includes RRC procedure delay defined in
clause 12 in TS 38.331 [2] and SFTD measurement reporting delay in
clause 9.3.8.3.</p>
<p>UE which fulfils the requirements in clause 9.3.8 is not supposed to
fulfil the requirements defined in clause 9.2.5.4.</p>
<h4 id="sftd-measurement-delay-1">9.3.8.2 SFTD Measurement delay</h4>
<p>The requirements on SFTD measurement delay defined in this clause are
applicable under the side condition SCH Ês/Iot ≥ -3 dB for the
inter-frequency neighbour cell. Depending on configuration, the SFTD
measurement may be carried out with or without the support of configured
measurement gaps. In the current release, indication on whether to carry
out the SFTD measurement with or without measurement gaps is implicit
and depending on whether measurement gaps are configured.</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to detect, identify and measure SFTD of up to 3
of the strongest applicable inter-frequency neighbour cells on the
carrier frequency provided in the SFTD measurement configuration.
Further depending on the SFTD measurement configuration, the UE shall
additionally report SS-RSRP for the one or more strongest cells. The UE
may or may not be configured with <em>cellsForWhichToReportSFTD</em>.
The UE does not expect <em>cellsForWhichToReportSFTD</em> to change
during an ongoing SFTD measurement.</p>
<p>When no measurement gaps are provided, the UE shall be capable of
finding the inter-frequency neighbour cell regardless of its SSB
position in the SMTC period, provided that the carrier frequency where
SFTD measurement is configured and the serving carrier(s) form a
supported CA or NR-DC band combination of the UE. The SFTD measurement
shall be conducted with sustained connection to the PCell and activated
SCell(s) in MCG. Depending on capability, the UE may be allowed to cause
a certain amount of interruptions for reconfiguration of the radio
receiver, as specified in clause 8.2.2.2.6.</p>
<p>When measurement gaps are provided, the UE shall be capable of
finding the inter-frequency neighbour cell under the additional
condition that the SSB at least occasionally falls within the
measurement gap.</p>
<p>When no DRX is used, the UE shall be capable of determining SFTD
within a physical layer measurement period of T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub>
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- For SFTD measurements without measurement gaps, and without
additional SS-RSRP reporting:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- For carrier frequency in FR1: T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> = 14 SMTC
periods</p>
<p>- For carrier frequency in FR2: T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> = 112 SMTC
periods</p>
<p>- For SFTD measurements in measurement gaps, and without additional
SS-RSRP reporting:</p>
<p>- For carrier frequency in FR1: T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> =
CSSF<sub>inter</sub> × 8 × Max(MGRP, SMTC period)</p>
<p>- For carrier frequency in FR2: T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> =
CSSF<sub>inter</sub> × 64 × Max(MGRP, SMTC period))</p>
<p>- For SFTD measurements without measurement gaps, and with additional
SS-RSRP reporting:</p>
<p>- For carrier frequency in FR1: T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> = 19 SMTC
periods</p>
<p>- For carrier frequency in FR2: T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> = 152 SMTC
periods</p>
<p>- For SFTD measurements in measurement gaps, and with additional
SS-RSRP reporting:</p>
<p>- For carrier frequency in FR1: T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> =
CSSF<sub>inter</sub> × 13 × Max(MGRP, SMTC period)</p>
<p>- For carrier frequency in FR2: T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> =
CSSF<sub>inter</sub> × 104 × Max(MGRP, SMTC period)</p>
<p>where CSSF<sub>inter</sub> is a carrier specific scaling factor and
is determined according to CSSF<sub>within_gap,i</sub> in clause 9.1.5.2
for measurement conducted within measurement gaps.</p>
<p>When DRX is used, the same T<sub>measure_SFTD1</sub> as for non-DRX
applies, but the reporting delay depends on the DRX cycle length in
use.</p>
<p>In case PCell is changed due to handover, the UE shall terminate the
inter-frequency SFTD measurement.</p>
<p>The measurement accuracy for the SFTD measurement shall fulfil the
requirement in clause 10.1.21.3. The measurement accuracy for
additionally reported SS-RSRP shall fulfil the requirement in clauses
10.1.4.1 and 10.1.5.1 for neighbour cell in FR1 and FR2,
respectively.</p>
<h4 id="sftd-measurement-reporting-delay-1">9.3.8.3 SFTD Measurement
reporting delay</h4>
<p>The SFTD measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between a
command that will trigger an SFTD measurement report and the point when
the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface.
This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by
other RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay
excludes a delay uncertainty of 2 × TTI<sub>DCCH</sub> resulting when
inserting the measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. This
measurement reporting delay excludes any delay caused by lack of UL
resources for UE to send the measurement report.</p>
<p>The SFTD measurement reporting delay shall be less than

procedure delay defined in TS 38.331 [2].</p>

NR inter-frequency measurements in carrier frequencies with CCA</h2>
<h3 id="a.1-introduction-2">9.3A.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The requirements in clause 9.3A apply for inter-frequency
measurements on a carrier frequency with CCA. A measurement is defined
as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement provided it is not defined
as an intra-frequency measurement according to clause 9.2A.The UE shall
be able to identify new inter-frequency cells in carrier frequencies
with CCA and perform SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of
identified inter-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is
provided by PCell or PSCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with
physical layer cell identities is provided.</p>
<p>When the inter-frequency measurement is performed on a neighbour cell
in FR2-2 with shared spectrum channel access, UE shall determine the CCA
mode of the neighbour cell according to
<em>channelAccessMode2-r17</em>of the cell configured in
<em>MeasObjectNR</em>. If <em>channelAccessMode2-r17</em> of the cell is
enabled, UE shall assume that CCA applies to the cell and perform
measurement accordingly, and the requirements in clause 9.3A shall
apply; otherwise, UE shall assume that CCA does not apply to the cell
and perform measurement accordingly, and requirements in 9.3 shall
apply.</p>
<p>SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement
object.</p>
<p>When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect
SSB on an inter-frequency measurement object which start earlier than
the gap starting time + switching time, nor detect SSB which end later
than the gap end – switching time.</p>
<p>In the requirements of clause 9.3A, the term SMTC occasion not
available at the UE refers to when the SMTC contains SSBs configured by
gNB in a cell on a carrier frequency subject to CCA, but N candidate SSB
positions for the same SS/PBCH block index within the discovery burst
transmission window are not available at the UE due to DL CCA failures
at gNB during the corresponding evaluation or measurement period,
where:</p>
<p>- For the cell detection procedure: N is at least one candidate SSB
position (NOTE: the one candidate SSB position for the cell detection
shall not be impacted by the set of candidate SSB positions which are
already being measured by the UE within the current measurement period
of the on-going measurements), and</p>
<p>- For other procedures in clause 9.3A: N are the first two successive
candidate SSB positions when two or more candidate SSB positions are
configured for this SSB index in one discovery burst transmission
window, otherwise N is one candidate SSB position;</p>
<p>otherwise the SMTC occasion is considered as available at the UE.</p>
<p>For the FR2-2 requirements of clause 9.3A, an SMTC occasion group
consists of N consecutive SMTC occasions. An SMTC occasion group is not
available, when at least one SMTC occasion in the group is not
transmitted by the gNB.</p>
<h3 id="a.2-requirements-applicability-1">9.3A.2 Requirements

<p>The requirements in clause 9.3A apply, provided:</p>

<p>If the UE requires measurement gaps to perform inter-frequency
measurements, a single measurement gap pattern is used for all
concurrent inter-frequency measurements, including inter-frequency
channel occupancy measurements. The RSSI measurement duration used for
channel occupancy measurement and the measurement gap should be aligned,
and the following additional condition should be fulfilled:</p>
<p>- Entire RSSI measurement duration should be contained in the
measurement gap.</p>
<p>The channel occupancy measurement performed and reported according to
this clause shall meet the channel occupancy measurement accuracy
requirements in Clause 10.1.35.2. The reported channel occupancy
measurement values contained in measurement reports shall be based on

inter-frequency measurements for RedCap</h2>
<h3 id="b.1-introduction-1">9.3B.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>A measurement is defined as an SSB based inter-frequency measurement
provided it is not defined as an intra-frequency measurement according
to clause 9.2B.</p>
<p>The UE shall be able to identify new inter-frequency cells and
perform SS-RSRP, SS-RSRQ, and SS-SINR measurements of identified
inter-frequency cells if carrier frequency information is provided by
PCell, even if no explicit neighbour list with physical layer cell
identities is provided.</p>
<p>A measurement is defined as an inter-frequency SSB based measurements
without measurement gaps for UE capable of
<em>interFrequencyMeas-NoGap</em> provided</p>
<p>- the UE supports <em>interFrequencyMeas-Nogap-r16</em> [15], and</p>
<p>- the SSB is completely contained in the active BWP of the UE.</p>
<p>For inter-frequency SSB based measurements without measurement gaps,
UE may cause scheduling restriction as specified in clause
[9.3B.7.3].</p>
<p>SSB based measurements are configured along with a measurement timing
configuration (SMTC) per carrier, which provides periodicity, duration
and offset information on a window of up to 5ms where the measurements
on the configured inter-frequency carrier are to be performed. For
inter-frequency connected mode measurements, one measurement window
periodicity may be configured per inter-frequency measurement
object.</p>
<p>When measurement gaps are needed, the UE is not expected to detect
SSB on an inter-frequency measurement object which start earlier than
the gap starting time + switching time, nor detect SSB which ends later
than the gap end – switching time. When the serving cells are in FR2,
the inter-frequency cells are in FR2 and the per-UE gap or per-FR gap is
configured to the UE in SA NR, the switching time is 0.25ms. Otherwise
the switching time is 0.5ms.</p>
<p>Longer measurement period would be expected during the period
T<sub>identify_CGI_RedCap</sub> when the UE is requested to decode an
NR/E-UTRA CGI.</p>

TTI<sub>DCCH</sub> where TTI<sub>DCCH</sub> is the duration of subframe

reporting delay excludes a delay which caused by no UL resources for UE

<p>The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between an
event that will trigger a measurement report and the point when the UE
starts to transmit the measurement report over the air interface. This
requirement assumes that the measurement report is not delayed by other
RRC signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the measurement report to the
TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty is: 2 x TTI<sub>DCCH</sub>
where TTI<sub>DCCH</sub> is the duration of subframe or slot or subslot
when the measurement report is transmitted on the PUSCH with subframe or
slot or subslot duration. This measurement reporting delay excludes a
delay which caused by no UL resources for UE to send the measurement
report.</p>
<p>The event triggered measurement reporting delay, measured without L3
filtering shall be less than T <sub>Identify_RedCap, E-UTRAN FDD</sub>

expected.</p>
<p>If a cell which has been detectable at least for the time period
T<sub>Identify_RedCap, E-UTRAN FDD</sub> becomes undetectable for a
period ≤ 5 seconds and then the cell becomes detectable again and
triggers an event as per TS 38.331 [2], the event triggered measurement
reporting delay shall be less than T<sub>Measure_RedCap, E-UTRAN
FDD</sub> provided the timing to that cell has not changed more than ±
50 Ts while measurement gap has not been available and the L3 filter has
not been used.</p>

Applicability</h4>
<p>The requirements in clause 9.9.2 apply for periodic and triggered
RSTD measurements, provided:</p>
<p>- PRS-RSTD related side conditions given in clause 10.1.23 for FR1
and FR2 are fulfilled, for a corresponding Band.</p>

Reporting Requirements</h4>
<p>The measurement reporting delay is defined as the time between the
moment when the periodic measurement report is triggered and the moment
when the UE starts to transmit the measurement report over the air
interface. This requirement assumes that the measurement report is not
delayed by other LPP signalling on the DCCH. This measurement reporting
delay excludes a delay uncertainty resulted when inserting the
measurement report to the TTI of the uplink DCCH. The delay uncertainty
is: 2 x TTI<sub>DCCH</sub> where TTI<sub>DCCH</sub> is the duration of
subframe or slot or subslot when the measurement report is transmitted
on the PUSCH with subframe or slot or subslot duration. This measurement
reporting delay excludes any delay caused by no UL resources for UE to
send the measurement report.</p>
<p>The reported RSTD measurement values contained in measurement reports
shall be based on the measurement report mapping requirements specified
in clauses 10.1.23.3.</p>
<p>The RSTD measurements performed and reported according to this
section shall meet the RSTD measurement accuracy requirements in clause
10.1.23, for each measured DL PRS resource.</p>
