<h2 id="radio-link-monitoring">8.1 Radio Link Monitoring</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">8.1.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The requirements in clause 8.1 apply for radio link monitoring
on:</p>
<p>- PCell in SA NR, NR-DC and NE-DC operation mode,</p>
<p>- PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Deactivated PSCell in NR-DC and EN-DC operation mode, when
configured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell, PSCell and deactivated PSCell
if configured with <em>bfd-and-RLM</em> with value <em>true</em> as
specified in TS 38.213 [3]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all
SSBs, or all CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required
to perform RLM outside the active DL BWP.</p>
<p>On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio
link quality and compare it to the thresholds Q<sub>out</sub> and
Q<sub>in</sub> for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality
of the cell.</p>
<p>When a CORESET that the UE uses for monitoring PDCCH includes two TCI
states and the UE is provided <em>sfnSchemePdcch</em> set to
'sfnSchemeA' or 'sfnSchemeB', the UE shall estimate a single downlink
radio link quality to derive single SNR and compare it to the single
thresholds Q<sub>out</sub> and Q<sub>in</sub> for the purpose of
monitoring downlink radio link quality of the cell(s). How to compute
the single SNR based on two active TCI states is up to UE
implementation.</p>
<p>The threshold Q<sub>out</sub> is defined as the level at which the
downlink radio link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to
the out-of-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>out</sub>) as defined in
Table 8.1.1-1. For SSB based radio link monitoring, Q<sub>out_SSB</sub>
is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters
listed in Table 8.1.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based radio link monitoring,
Q<sub>out_CSI-RS</sub> is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1.3.1-1.</p>
<p>The threshold Q<sub>in</sub> is defined as the level at which the
downlink radio link quality can be received with significantly higher
reliability than at Q<sub>out</sub> and shall correspond to the in-sync
block error rate (BLER<sub>in</sub>) as defined in Table 8.1.1-1. For
SSB based radio link monitoring, Q<sub>in_SSB</sub> is derived based on
the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table
8.1.2.1-2. For CSI-RS based radio link monitoring, Q<sub>in_CSI-RS</sub>
is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters
listed in Table 8.1.3.1-2.</p>
<p>The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>out</sub>) and in-sync
block error rate (BLER<sub>in</sub>) are determined from the network
configuration via parameter <em>rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</em>
signalled by higher layers. When UE is not configured with
<em>rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</em> from the network, UE determines
out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from Configuration #0 in Table
8.1.1-1 by default. All requirements in clause 8.1 are applicable for
BLER Configuration #0 in Table 8.1.1-1.</p>

Introduction of Requirement on Radio Link Monitoring for UE Configured
with Relaxed Measurement Criteria</h4>
<p>For the UE supports <em>rlm-Relaxation-r17</em>and configured with
explicit signaling <em>goodServingCellEvaluationRLM</em>, which is
always configured to the UE when the network enables RLM relaxation for
the UE as specified in TS 38.331 [2], the relaxed requirements defined
in clause 8.1.2.4 for SSB based radio link monitoring and the relaxed
requirements defined in clause 8.1.3.4 for CSI-RS based radio link
monitoring are allowed to apply to the relaxed RLM measurements on
SpCell after fulfilling the following conditions:</p>
<p>- for the serving cells in intra-band carrier aggregation configured
with SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on SpCell together with CSI-RS based
BFD on SCell, when</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- the good serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2
of TS 38.331 [2] is fulfilled for the serving cell based on the
measurements that are configured for SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on
SpCell together with CSI-RS based BFD on Scell in the intra-band carrier
aggregation if the <em>lowMobilityEvaluationConnected</em> is not
configured, or</p>
<p>- the UE is also configured with
<em>lowMobilityEvaluationConnected</em> and both low mobility criterion
defined in clause 5.7.13.1 of TS 38.331 [2] is fulfilled for a period of
<em>T<sub>SearchDeltaP-Connected</sub></em> and good serving cell
quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331 [2] is
fulfilled for the serving cell based on the measurements that are
configured for SSB-based or CSI-RS based RLM on SpCell together with
CSI-RS based BFD on Scell in the intra-band carrier aggregation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>- for other serving cells, when</p>
<p>- the good serving cell quality criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2
of TS 38.331 [2] is fulfilled for the SpCell if the
<em>lowMobilityEvaluationConnected</em> is not configured, or</p>
<p>- the UE is also configured with
<em>lowMobilityEvaluationConnected</em> and both low mobility criterion
defined in clause 5.7.13.1 of TS 38.331 [2] is fulfilled for a period of
T<sub>SearchDeltaP-Connected</sub> and good serving cell quality
criterion defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331 [2] is fulfilled for
the SpCell.</p>
<p>otherwise, UE shall apply the requirements defined in clause 8.1.2.2
for SSB based radio link monitoring and the requirements defined in
clause 8.1.3.2 for CSI-RS based radio link monitoring. Note that when
multiple resources are configured on a serving cell for RLM or BFD
evaluation, the good serving cell quality critierion is considered as
fulfilled for the serving cell when any resource configured for the cell
fulfills the good serving defined in clause 5.7.13.2 of TS 38.331
[2].</p>
<p>The UE is no longer allowed to relax RLM measurements and apply the
relaxed radio link monitoring provided that at least one of the
following conditions is met:</p>
<p>- The UE sends out-of sync indications to the higher layers,</p>
<p>- The timer T310 is running.</p>
<p>- No DRX is used or DRX cycle is longer than 80ms</p>

<h3 id="a.1-introduction">8.1A.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The requirements in clause 8.1A apply for radio link monitoring on a
carrier frequency with CCA for cells:</p>
<p>- PCell in SA NR operation mode,</p>
<p>- PSCell in EN-DC operation mode.</p>
<p>- PSCell in NR-DC operation mode.</p>
<p>The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell and PSCell as specified in
TS 38.213 [3]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or all
CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required to perform RLM
outside the active DL BWP.</p>
<p>On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio
link quality and compare it to the thresholds Q<sub>out,CCA</sub> and
Q<sub>in,CCA</sub> for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link
quality of the cell.</p>
<p>The threshold Q<sub>out,CCA</sub> is defined as the level at which
the downlink radio link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond
to the out-of-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>out,CCA</sub>) as defined
in Table 8.1A.1-1. For SSB based radio link monitoring,
Q<sub>out_SSB,CCA</sub> is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1A.2.1-1.</p>
<p>The threshold Q<sub>in,CCA</sub> is defined as the level at which the
downlink radio link quality can be received with significantly higher
reliability than at Q<sub>out,CCA</sub> and shall correspond to the
in-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>in</sub>) as defined in Table
8.1A.1-1. For SSB based radio link monitoring, Q<sub>in_SSB,CCA</sub> is
derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed
in Table 8.1A.2.1-2.</p>
<p>The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>out,CCA</sub>) and in-sync
block error rate (BLER<sub>in,CCA</sub>) are determined from the network
configuration via parameter <em>rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</em>
signalled by higher layers. When UE is not configured with
<em>rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</em> from the network, UE determines
out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from Configuration #0 in Table
8.1A.1-1 as default. All requirements in clause 8.1A are applicable for

<p>8.1A.2.3 Measurement Restrictions for SSB based RLM</p>
<p>The UE is required to be capable of measuring SSB for RLM without
measurement gaps. The UE is required to perform the SSB measurements
with measurement restrictions as described in the following clauses.</p>
<p>For FR1, when the SSB for RLM is in the same OFDM symbol as CSI-RS
for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement,</p>
<p>- If SSB and CSI-RS have same SCS, UE shall be able to measure the
SSB for RLM without any restriction;</p>
<p>- If SSB and CSI-RS have different SCS,</p>
<p>- If UE supports <em>simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology</em>, UE
shall be able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;</p>
<p>- If UE does not support
<em>simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology</em>, UE is required to measure
SSB for RLM.</p>
<p>For FR2-2, when the SSB for RLM measurement on one CC is in the same
OFDM symbol as CSI-RS for RLM, BFD, CBD or L1-RSRP measurement on the
same CC or different CCs in the same band, UE is required to measure one
of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period for
SSB based RLM is expected, and no requirements are defined.</p>
<h3 id="a.3-minimum-requirement-at-transitions">8.1A.3 Minimum
requirement at transitions</h3>
<p>When the UE transitions between DRX and no DRX or when DRX cycle
periodicity changes, for each RLM-RS resource, for a duration of time
equal to the evaluation period corresponding to the second mode after
the transition occurs, the UE shall use an evaluation period that is no
less than the minimum of evaluation period corresponding to the first
mode and the second mode. Subsequent to this duration, the UE shall use
an evaluation period corresponding to the second mode for each RLM-RS
resource. This requirement shall be applied to both out-of-sync
evaluation and in-sync evaluation of the monitored cell.</p>
<p>When the UE transitions from a first configuration of RLM resources
to a second configuration of RLM resources that is different from the
first configuration, for each RLM resource present in the second

<h2 id="b-radio-link-monitoring-for-redcap">8.1B Radio Link Monitoring
for RedCap</h2>
<h3 id="b.1-introduction">8.1B.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The requirements in clause 8.1B apply for radio link monitoring on UE
with reduced capabilites:</p>
<p>- PCell in SA NR operation mode,</p>
<p>The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link quality based on the
reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s) in order to detect the
downlink radio link quality of the PCell as specified in TS 38.213 [3].
The configured RLM-RS resources can be all SSBs, or all CSI-RSs, or a
mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required to perform RLM outside the
active DL BWP. The SSB and SMTC in this section applies for both CD-SSB
and NCD-SSB if it is not additional specified.</p>
<p>On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio
link quality and compare it to the thresholds Q<sub>out,RedCap</sub> and
Q<sub>in,RedCap</sub> for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link
quality of the cell.</p>
<p>The threshold Q<sub>out,RedCap</sub> is defined as the level at which
the downlink radio link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond
to the out-of-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>out</sub>) as defined in
Table 8.1B.1-1. For SSB based radio link monitoring,
Q<sub>out_SSB,RedCap</sub> is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1B.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based
radio link monitoring, Q<sub>out_CSI-RS,RedCap</sub> is derived based on
the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table
8.1B.3.1-1.</p>
<p>The threshold Q<sub>in,RedCap</sub> is defined as the level at which
the downlink radio link quality can be received with significantly
higher reliability than at Q<sub>out,RedCap</sub> and shall correspond
to the in-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>in,RedCap</sub>) as defined in
Table 8.1B.1-1. For SSB based radio link monitoring,
Q<sub>in_SSB,RedCap</sub> is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1B.2.1-2. For CSI-RS based
radio link monitoring, Q<sub>in_CSI-RS,RedCap</sub> is derived based on
the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table
8.1B.3.1-2.</p>
<p>The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>out,RedCap</sub>) and
in-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>in,RedCap</sub>) are determined from
the network configuration via parameter
<em>rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</em> signalled by higher layers. When UE
is not configured with <em>rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</em> from the
network, UE determines out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from
Configuration #0 in Table 8.1B.1-1 by default. All requirements in
clause 8.1B are applicable for BLER Configuration #0 in Table
8.1B.1-1.</p>

shall be able to measure the SSB for RLM without any restriction;</p>
<p>- If UE does not support
<em>simultaneousRxDataSSB-DiffNumerology</em>, UE is required to measure
one of but not both SSB for RLM and CSI-RS. Longer measurement period

Monitoring for Satellite Access</h2>
<h3 id="c.1-introduction">8.1C.1 Introduction</h3>
<p>The requirements in clause 8.1C apply for radio link monitoring on
PCell and the UE is configured with only PCell, which is served by
satellite access node (SAN).The UE shall monitor the downlink radio link
quality based on the reference signal configured as RLM-RS resource(s)
in order to detect the downlink radio link quality of the PCell as
specified in TS 38.213 [3]. The configured RLM-RS resources can be all
SSBs, or all CSI-RSs, or a mix of SSBs and CSI-RSs. UE is not required
to perform RLM outside the active DL BWP.</p>
<p>On each RLM-RS resource, the UE shall estimate the downlink radio
link quality and compare it to the thresholds Q<sub>out</sub> and
Q<sub>in</sub> for the purpose of monitoring downlink radio link quality
of the cell.</p>
<p>The threshold Q<sub>out</sub> is defined as the level at which the
downlink radio link cannot be reliably received and shall correspond to
the out-of-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>out</sub>) as defined in
Table 8.1C.1-1. For SSB based radio link monitoring, Q<sub>out_SSB</sub>
is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters
listed in Table 8.1C.2.1-1. For CSI-RS based radio link monitoring,
Q<sub>out_CSI-RS</sub> is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1C.3.1-1.</p>
<p>The threshold Q<sub>in</sub> is defined as the level at which the
downlink radio link quality can be received with significantly higher
reliability than at Q<sub>out</sub> and shall correspond to the in-sync
block error rate (BLER<sub>in</sub>) as defined in Table 8.1C.1-1. For
SSB based radio link monitoring, Q<sub>in_SSB</sub> is derived based on
the hypothetical PDCCH transmission parameters listed in Table
8.1C.2.1-2. For CSI-RS based radio link monitoring,
Q<sub>in_CSI-RS</sub> is derived based on the hypothetical PDCCH
transmission parameters listed in Table 8.1C.3.1-2.</p>
<p>The out-of-sync block error rate (BLER<sub>out</sub>) and in-sync
block error rate (BLER<sub>in</sub>) are determined from the network
configuration via parameter <em>rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</em>
signalled by higher layers. When UE is not configured with
<em>rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold</em> from the network, UE determines
out-of-sync and in-sync block error rates from Configuration #0 in Table
8.1C.1-1 by default. All requirements in clause 8.1C are applicable for
BLER Configuration #0 in Table 8.1C.1-1.</p>

Interruptions at NR SRS antenna port switching</h5>
<p>The requirements in this clause are applicable to SRS antenna port
switching on FR1 and SRS resource(s) is only configured within the last
6 symbols of a slot. For interruption caused by SRS antenna port
switching, the victim cell is based on the entry number of the band
indicated by <em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> and/or
<em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em> regardless of per-FR MG capability. An
UL interruption is allowed on any of the serving cells as indicated in
<em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em>, and a DL interruption is allowed on
any of the serving cells as indicated in
<em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em>.</p>
<p>The UE shall perform SRS antenna port switching only if the below
conditions are met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other UL transmission
with higher priority defined in TS 38.214 [26] if the serving cell on
which the higher priority transmission is performed is a victim cell
based on <em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em> or is the same carrier on
which SRS is transmitted.</p>
<p>- the SRS switching is not colliding with any NR measurements (i.e.
SSB/CSI-RS based L1/L3 measurements) and the measurements for
RLM/BFD/CBD if the serving cell on which the NR measurements and the
measurements for RLM/BFD/CBD is performed is a victim cell based on
<em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> or is the same carrier on which SRS is
transmitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No requirements are defined for SRS antenna port switching if
aperiodic SRS switching is colliding with aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR
measurements and the serving cell on which the aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR
measurement is configured is indicated in <em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> or
is the same carrier on which aperiodic SRS is scheduled/configured.</p>
<p>No requirements apply when SRS antenna port switching is colliding
with E-UTRA measurement if the carrier on which the E-UTRA measurement
is performed is indicated in <em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> or is the same
carrier on which SRS is scheduled/configured.When 1 SRS symbol is
configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching and the aggressor and
victim cells are synchronized, the interruption requirement in Table
8.2.1.2.18-1 applies.</p>
<p>When 1 SRS symbol is configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching
and the aggressor and victim cells are asynchronized, the interruption
requirement in Table 8.2.1.2.18-2 applies. For the rest of SRS
configurations, the interruption requirement in Table 8.2.1.2.18-3

<p>The requirements in this clause are applicable to SRS antenna port
switching on FR1 and SRS resource(s) is only configured within the last
6 symbols of a slot. For interruption caused by SRS antenna port
switching, the victim cell is based on the entry number of the band
indicated by <em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> and/or
<em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em> regardless of per-FR MG capability. An
UL interruption is allowed on any of the serving cells as indicated in
<em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em>, and a DL interruption is allowed on
any of the serving cells as indicated in
<em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em>.</p>
<p>The UE shall perform SRS antenna port switching only if the below
conditions are met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other UL transmission
with higher priority defined in TS 38.214 [26] if the serving cell on
which the higher priority transmission is performed is a victim cell
based on <em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em> or is the same carrier on
which SRS is transmitted.</p>
<p>- the SRS switching is not colliding with any NR measurements (i.e.
SSB/CSI-RS based L1/L3 measurements) and the measurements for
RLM/BFD/CBD if the serving cell on which the NR measurements and the
measurements for RLM/BFD/CBD is performed is a victim cell based on
<em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> or is the same carrier on which SRS is
transmitted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No requirements are defined for SRS antenna port switching if
aperiodic SRS switching is colliding with aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR
measurements and the serving cell on which the aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR
measurement is configured is indicated in <em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> or
is the same carrier on which aperiodic SRS is scheduled/configured.</p>
<p>When 1 SRS symbol is configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching

<p>8.2.3.2.16 Interruptions at NR SRS antenna port switching</p>
<p>The requirements in this clause are applicable to SRS antenna port
switching on FR1 and SRS resource(s) is only configured within the last
6 symbols of a slot. For interruption caused by SRS antenna port
switching, the victim cell is based on the entry number of the band
indicated by <em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> and/or
<em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em> regardless of per-FR MG capability. An
UL interruption is allowed on any of the serving cells as indicated in
<em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em>, and a DL interruption is allowed on
any of the serving cells as indicated in
<em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em>.</p>
<p>The UE shall perform SRS antenna port switching only if the below
conditions are met.</p>
<p>- the SRS switching is not colliding with any other UL transmission
with higher priority defined in TS 38.214 [26] if the serving cell on
which the higher priority transmission is performed is a victim cell
based on <em>txSwitchWithAnotherBand</em> or is the same carrier on
which SRS is transmitted.</p>
<p>- the SRS switching is not colliding with any NR measurements (i.e.
SSB/CSI-RS based L1/L3 measurements) and the measurements for
RLM/BFD/CBD if the serving cell on which the NR measurements and the
measurements for RLM/BFD/CBD is performed is a victim cell based on
<em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> or is the same carrier on which SRS is
transmitted.</p>
<p>No requirements are defined for SRS antenna port switching if
aperiodic SRS switching is colliding with aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR
measurements and the serving cell on which the aperiodic L1-RSRP/L1-SINR
measurement is configured is indicated in <em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> or
is the same carrier on which aperiodic SRS is scheduled/configured.</p>
<p>No requirements apply when SRS antenna port switching is colliding
with E-UTRA measurement if the carrier on which the E-UTRA measurement
is performed is indicated in <em>txSwitchImpactToRx</em> or is the same
carrier on which SRS is scheduled/configured.</p>
<p>When 1 SRS symbol is configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching
and the aggressor and victim cells are synchronized, the interruption
requirement in Table 8.2.3.2.16-1 applies. When 1 SRS symbol is
configured in a slot for SRS antenna switching and the aggressor and
victim cells are asynchronized, the interruption requirement in Table
8.2.3.2.16-2 applies. For the rest of SRS configurations, the
interruption requirement in Table 8.2.3.2.16-3 applies.</p>

equal to max(5 measCycleSCell, 5 DRX cycles) also remains detectable in
the SMTC occasions available at the UE during the SCell activation delay
according to the cell identification conditions specified in clause 9.2A

<p>Otherwise SCell operating with CCA in FR1 is unknown.</p>

reporting, the reported SSBs with indexes remain detectable according to
the cell identification conditions specified in clauses 9.2 and 9.3, and
the TCI state is selected based on one of the latest reported SSB
indexes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the first SCell with CCA in FR2-2 band is unknown. The

commands for PDCCH TCI, PDSCH TCI (when applicable), semi-persistent
CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable), and configuration message
for TCI of periodic CSI-RS for CQI reporting (when applicable) are based

T<sub>SMTC_MAX</sub> follows <em>smtc1</em> or <em>smtc2</em> according
to the physical cell IDs of the target cells being activated and the
active serving cells.</p>
<p>In addition to CSI reporting defined above, UE shall also apply other
actions related to the activation command specified in TS 38.331 [2] for
a SCell at the first opportunities for the corresponding actions once
the SCell is activated.</p>

interruptions are allowed during SCell activation. When
L<sub>3,1</sub>&gt;0, performance degradation may be expected on any

<p>- For a single interruption (L=0), interruption window length at
SCell activation does not depend on DL CCA failures.</p>
<p>For inter-band CA,</p>

Requirements for CSI-RS based beam failure detection</h3>
<h4 id="introduction-12">8.5.3.1 Introduction</h4>
<p>The requirements in this clause apply for each CSI-RS resource in the
set <img src="media/image5.svg"
style="width:0.16667in;height:0.21667in" /> of resource configurations
for a serving cell, provided that the CSI-RS resource(s) in set <img
src="media/image5.svg" style="width:0.16667in;height:0.21667in" />for
beam failure detection are actually transmitted within the UE active DL
BWP during the entire evaluation period specified in clause 8.5.3.2. UE
is not expected to perform beam failure detection measurements on the
CSI-RS configured for BFD if the CSI-RS is not QCL-ed, with QCL-TypeD
when applicable, with the RS in the active TCI state of any CORESET
configured in the UE active BWP. The requirements in this clause apply
when UE is required to perform beam failure detection on no more than 1
serving cell per band.</p>

<blockquote>

is not considered to be overlapped by a gap occasion if the gap occasion
is dropped according to 9.1.8.</p>
<p>Note: The overlap between CSI-RS for BFD and SMTC means that CSI-RS
for BFD is within the SMTC window duration.</p>
<p>Longer evaluation period would be expected if the combination of the

OFDM symbol as SSB for RLM, BFD or L1-RSRP measurement on the same CC or
different CCs in the same band, or in the same symbol as SSB for CBD
measurement on the same CC or different CCs in the same band when beam
