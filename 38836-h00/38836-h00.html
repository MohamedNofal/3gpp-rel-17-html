UE-to-Network Relay</h1>
<h2 id="scenarios-assumptions-and-requirements">4.1 Scenarios,
Assumptions and Requirements </h2>
<p>The UE-to-Network Relay enables coverage extension and power saving
for the Remote UE. The coverage scenarios considered in this study are
the following:</p>
<p>- UE-to-Network Relay UE is in coverage and Remote UE is out of
coverage</p>
<p>- UE-to-Network Relay UE and Remote UE are both in coverage</p>
<p>- For L3 UE-to-Network Relay, Relay UE and Remote UE can be in the
same cell or different cells, after Remote UE establishes connection via
Relay UE</p>
<p>- For L2 UE-to-Network Relay, it is supported as baseline that after
Remote UE connects via Relay UE, Relay UE and Remote UE are controlled
by the Relay UE's serving cell</p>
<p>For L2 UE-to-Network Relay, both cases below are supported, i.e.</p>
<p>- Before remote connection via Relay UE, Relay UE and Remote UE are
in the same cell;</p>
<p>- Before remote connection via Relay UE, Relay UE and Remote UE are
in different cells;</p>
<p><strong>The considered scenarios are reflected in Figure
4.1-1.</strong></p>
<p><img src="media/image3.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4.1-1: Scenarios for UE-to-Network Relay</p>
<p>NR Uu is assumed on the Uu link of the UE-to-Network Relay UE. NR
sidelink is assumed on PC5 between the Remote UE(s) and the
UE-to-Network Relay UE.</p>
<p>Cross-RAT configuration/control of UE (Remote UE or UE-to-Network
Relay UE) is not considered, i.e., eNB/ng-eNB do not control/configure
an NR Remote UE and UE-to-Network Relay UE. For UE-to-Network Relay, the
study focuses on unicast data traffic between the Remote UE and the
Network.</p>
<p>Configuring/scheduling of a UE (Remote UE or UE-to-Network Relay UE)
by the SN to perform NR sidelink communication is out of scope of this
study.</p>
<p>For UE-to-Network Relay, relaying of unicast data between the Remote
UE and the network can occur after a PC5-RRC connection is established
between the Relay UE and the Remote UE.</p>
<p>The Uu RRC state of the Relay UE and Remote UE can change when
connected via PC5. Both Relay UE and Remote UE can perform relay
discovery in any RRC state. A Remote UE can perform relay discovery
while out of Uu coverage.</p>
<p>A Relay UE must be in RRC_CONNECTED to perform relaying of unicast
data.</p>
<p>For L2 UE-to-Network Relay:</p>
<p>- Remote UE(s) must be in RRC CONNECTED to perform
transmission/reception of relayed unicast data.</p>
<p>- The Relay UE can be in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED as
long as all the PC5-connected Remote UE(s) are in RRC_IDLE.</p>
<p>- The Relay UE can be in RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED as long as all
the PC5-connected Remote UE(s) are in RRC_INACTIVE<em>.</em></p>
<p>For L3 UE-to-Network Relay, both Relay UE and Remote UE can be in
RRC_INACTIVE state.</p>
<p>The requirement of service continuity is only for UE-to-Network
Relay, but not for UE-to-UE Relay in this release.</p>
<p>RAN2 have studied the mobility scenario of "between direct (Uu) path
and indirect (via the relay) path" for UE-to-Nework relay. RAN2 focus on
the mobility scenarios of intra-gNB cases in the study phase, and assume
the inter-gNB cases will also be supported. For the inter-gNB cases,
compared to the intra-gNB cases, potential different parts on Uu
interface in details can be discussed in the WI phase.RAN2 deprioritize
work specific to the mobility scenario of "between indirect (via a first
Relay UE) and indirect (via a second Relay UE)" for path switching in
the SI phase, which can be studied in the WI phase, if needed.</p>
<p>RAN2 deprioritize the group mobility scenario in the SI phase, which
may be discussed in WI phase, if needed.</p>
<h2 id="discovery">4.2 Discovery</h2>
<p>Model A and model B discovery model as defined in clause 5.3.1.2 of
TS 23.303 [3] are supported for UE-to-Network Relay. The protocol stack
of discovery message is described in Figure 4.2-1.</p>
<p><img src="media/image4.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4.2-1: Protocol Stack of Discovery Message for UE-to-Network
Relay</p>
<p>For Relay UE of UE-to-Network Relay:</p>
<p>- The Relay UE needs to be within a minimum and a maximum Uu signal
strength threshold(s) if provided by gNB before it can transmit
discovery message when in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE state.</p>
<p>- Relay UE is allowed to transmit discovery message based on NR
sidelink communication configuration provided by gNB in all RRC
states.</p>
<p>- Relay UE supporting L3 UE-to-Network Relay is allowed to transmit
discovery message based on at least pre-configuration when it is
connected to a gNB which is not capable of sidelink relay operation, in
case its serving carrier is not shared with carrier for sidelink
operation.</p>
<p>- Relay UE supporting L2 UE-to-Network Relay should be always
connected to a gNB which is capable of sidelink relay operation
including providing configurations for transmission of discovery
messages.</p>
<p>For Remote UE of UE-to-Network Relay:</p>
<p>- The Remote UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE state is allowed to
transmit discovery message if measured signal strength of serving cell
is lower than a configured threshold.</p>
<p>- Whether Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED is allowed to transmit discovery
is based on configuration provided by serving gNB. The detail of
configuration provided by serving gNB can be discussed in WI phase.</p>
<p>- No additional network configuration is needed for Uu measurement by
Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.</p>
<p>- Remote UE out of coverage is always allowed to transmit discovery
message based on pre-configuration while not connected with network
through a Relay UE yet.</p>
<p>- Remote UE supporting UE-to-Network Relay is allowed to transmit
discovery message based on at least pre-configuration when it is
directly connected to a gNB which is not capable of sidelink relay
operation, in case its serving carrier is not shared with SL
carrier.</p>
<p>- For Remote UE supporting L3 UE-to-Network Relay which is out of
coverage and connected to a gNB indirectly, it is not feasible for the
serving gNB to provide radio configuration to transmit discovery
message.</p>
<p>- For Remote UE supporting L2 UE-to-Network Relay which is out of
coverage and connected to a gNB indirectly, whether it is allowed to
transmit discovery message based on configuration provided by the gNB
can be discussed in WI phase.</p>
<p>The detailed definition of a gNB which is not capable of sidelink
relay operation can be left for WI phase but at least should include the
case that the gNB does not provide SL relay configuration, e.g., no
discovery configuration.</p>
<p>Resource pool to transmit discovery message can be either shared with
or separated from resource pool for data transmission:</p>
<p>- For both shared resource pool and separated resource pool, a new
LCID is introduced for discovery message, i.e., discovery message is
carried by a new SL SRB.</p>
<p>- Within separated resource pool, discovery messages are treated
equally with each other during the LCP procedure.</p>
<h2 id="relay-re-selection-criterion-and-procedure">4.3 Relay
(re-)selection criterion and procedure</h2>
<p>The baseline solution for relay (re-)selection is as follow:</p>
<p>Radio measurements at PC5 interface are considered as part of relay
(re)selection criteria.</p>
<p>- Remote UE at least use the radio signal strength measurements of
sidelink discovery messages to evaluate whether PC5 link quality of a
Relay UE satisfies relay selection and reselection criterion.</p>
<p>- When Remote UE is connected to a Relay UE, it may use SL-RSRP
measurements on the sidelink unicast link to evaluate whether PC5 link
quality with the Relay UE satisfies relay reselection criterion.</p>
<p>Further details on the PC5 radio measurements criteria, e.g., in case
of no transmission on the sidelink unicast link can be discussed in WI
phase. How to perform RSRP measurement based on RSRP of discovery
message and/or SL-RSRP if Remote UE has PC5-RRC connection with Relay UE
can be decided in WI phase.</p>
<p>For relay selection, as in LTE, an in-coverage Remote UE searches for
a candidate Relay UE if direct Uu link quality of the Remote UE is below
a configured threshold.</p>
<p>For relay (re-)selection, Remote UE compares the PC5 radio
measurements of a Relay UE with the threshold which is configured by gNB
or preconfigured. Higher layer criteria also need to be considered by
Remote UE for relay (re-)selection, but details can be left to SA2 to
decide. Relay (re-)selection can be triggered by upper layers of Remote
UE.</p>
<p>Relay reselection should be triggered if the NR Sidelink signal
strength of current Sidelink relay is below a (pre)configured threshold.
Also, relay reselection may be triggered if RLF of PC5 link with current
Relay UE is detected by Remote UE.</p>
<p>The above-described baseline for relay (re)selection apply to both L2
and L3 solutions. But for RRC_CONNECTED Remote UE connected through L2
UE-to-Network Relay scenario, gNB decision on relay
selection/reselection is considered in WI phase under the above
baseline. Additional AS layer criteria can be considered in WI phase for
both L2 and L3 UE-to-Network Relay solutions.</p>
<p>For relay (re-)selection, when Remote UE has multiple suitable Relay
UE candidates which meet all AS-layer &amp; higher layer criteria and
Remote UE need to select one Relay UE by itself, it is up to Remote UE
implementation to choose one Relay UE. This does not exclude gNB
involvement in service continuity for UE-to-Network Relay scenarios.</p>
<h2 id="relayremote-ue-authorization">4.4 Relay/Remote UE
authorization</h2>
<p>It is concluded that no impact on RAN2 is foreseen due to
authorization of both Relay UE and Remote UE. The impact on RAN3, if
any, will be done in WI phase for UE-to-Network Relay only.</p>
<h2 id="layer-2-relay">4.5 Layer-2 Relay</h2>
<h3 id="architecture-and-protocol-stack">4.5.1 Architecture and Protocol
Stack</h3>
<h4 id="protocol-stack">4.5.1.1 Protocol Stack</h4>
<p>The protocol stacks for the user plane and control plane of L2
UE-to-Network Relay architecture are described in Figure 4.5.1.1-1 and
Figure 4.5.1.1-2 for the case where adaptation layer is not supported at
the PC5 interface, and Figure 4.5.1.1-3 and Figure 4.5.1.1-4 for the
case where adaptation layer is supported at the PC5 interface.</p>
<p>For L2 UE-to-Network Relay, the adaptation layer is placed over RLC
sublayer for both CP and UP at the Uu interface between Relay UE and
gNB. The Uu SDAP/PDCP and RRC are terminated between Remote UE and gNB,
while RLC, MAC and PHY are terminated in each link (i.e. the link
between Remote UE and UE-to-Network Relay UE and the link between
UE-to-Network Relay UE and the gNB). Whether the adaptation layer is
also supported at the PC5 interface between Remote UE and Relay UE is
left to WI phase (assuming down-selection first before studying too much
on the detailed PC5 adaptation layer functionalities).</p>

Relay<br />
(adaptation layer is supported at the PC5 interface)</p>
<h4 id="adaptation-layer-functionality">4.5.1.2 Adaptation layer
functionality</h4>
<p>For L2 UE-to-Network Relay, for uplink:</p>
<p>- The Uu adaptation layer at Relay UE supports UL bearer mapping
between ingress PC5 RLC channels for relaying and egress Uu RLC channels
over the Relay UE Uu path. For uplink relaying traffic, the different
end-to-end RBs (SRB, DRB) of the same Remote UE and/or different Remote
UEs can be subject to N:1 mapping and data multiplexing over one Uu RLC
channel.</p>
<p>- The Uu adaptation layer is used to support Remote UE identification
for the UL traffic (multiplexing the data coming from multiple Remote
UE). The identity information of Remote UE Uu Radio Bearer and Remote UE
is included in the Uu adaptation layer at UL in order for gNB to
correlate the received data packets for the specific PDCP entity
associated with the right Remote UE Uu Radio Bearer of a Remote UE.</p>
<p>For L2 UE-to-Network Relay, for downlink:</p>
<p>- The Uu adaptation layer can be used to support DL bearer mapping at
gNB to map end-to-end Radio Bearer (SRB, DRB) of Remote UE into Uu RLC
channel over Relay UE Uu path. The Uu adaptation layer can be used to
support DL N:1 bearer mapping and data multiplexing between multiple
end-to-end Radio Bearers (SRBs, DRBs) of a Remote UE and/or different
Remote UEs and one Uu RLC channel over the Relay UE Uu path.</p>
<p>- The Uu adaptation layer needs to support Remote UE identification
for Downlink traffic. The identity information of Remote UE Uu Radio
Bearer and the identity information of Remote UE needs be put into the
Uu adaptation layer by gNB at DL in order for Relay UE to map the
received data packets from Remote UE Uu Radio Bearer to its associated
PC5 RLC channel.</p>
<h3 id="qos">4.5.2 QoS</h3>
<p>gNB implementation can handle the QoS breakdown over Uu and PC5 for
the end-to-end QoS enforcement of a particular session established
between Remote UE and network in case of L2 UE-to-Network Relay. Details
of handling in case PC5 RLC channels with different end-to-end QoS are
mapped to the same Uu RLC channel can be discussed in WI phase.</p>
<h3 id="security">4.5.3 Security</h3>
<p>As described in clause 6.7.2.8 of TR 23.752, in case of L2
UE-to-Network Relay, the security (confidentiality and integrity
protection) is enforced at the PDCP layer between the endpoints at the
Remote UE and the gNB. The PDCP traffic is relayed securely over two
links, one between the Remote UE and the UE-to-Network Relay UE and the
other between the UE-to-Network Relay UE to the gNB.</p>
<h3 id="service-continuity">4.5.4 Service Continuity</h3>
<h4 id="general">4.5.4.0 General</h4>
<p>L2 UE-to-Nework Relay uses the RAN2 principle of the Rel-15 NR
handover procedure as the baseline AS layer solution to guarantee
service continuit, i.e. gNB hands over the Remote UE to a target cell or
target Relay UE, including:</p>
<p>1) Handover preparation type of procedure between gNB and Relay UE
(if needed);</p>
<p>2) RRCReconfiguration to Remote UE, Remote UE switching to the
target, and;</p>
<p>3) Handover complete message, similar to the legacy procedure.</p>
<p>Exact content of the messages (e.g. handover command) can be
discussed in WI phase. This does not imply that we will send inter-node
message over Uu.</p>
<p>Below, the common parts of intra-gNB cases and inter-gNB cases are
captured. For the inter-gNB cases, compared to the intra-gNB cases,
potential different parts on RAN2 Uu interface in details can be
discussed in WI phase.</p>
<h4 id="switching-from-indirect-to-direct-path">4.5.4.1 Switching from
indirect to direct path</h4>
<p>For service continuity of L2 UE-to-Network relay, the following
baseline procedure is used, in case of Remote UE switching to direct Uu
cell.</p>
<p><img src="media/image9.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4.5.4.1-1: Procedure for Remote UE switching to direct Uu
cell</p>
<p>Step 1: Measurement configuration and reporting</p>
<p>Step 2: Decision of switching to a direct cell by gNB</p>
<p>Step 3: RRC Reconfiguration message to Remote UE</p>
<p>Step 4: Remote UE performs Random Access to the gNB</p>
<p>Step 5: Remote UE feedback the RRCReconfigurationComplete to gNB via
target path, using the target configuration provided in the RRC
Reconfiguration message.</p>
<p>Step 6: RRC Reconfiguration to Relay UE</p>
<p>Step 7: The PC5 link is released between Remote UE and the Relay UE,
if needed.</p>
<p>Step 8: The data path switching.</p>
<p>NOTE: The order of step 6/7/8 is not restricted. Following are
further discussed in WI phase, including:<br />
- Whether Remote UE suspends data transmission via relay link after step
3;<br />
- Whether Step 6 can be before or after step 3 and its necessity;<br />
- Whether Step 7 can be after step 3 or step 5, and its
necessity/replaced by PC5 reconfiguration;<br />
- Whether Step 8 can be after step 5.</p>
<h4 id="switching-from-direct-to-indirect-path">4.5.4.2 Switching from
direct to indirect path</h4>
<p>For service continuity of L2 UE-to-Network Relay, the following
baseline procedure is used, in case of Remote UE switching to indirect
Relay UE:</p>
<p><img src="media/image10.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4.5.4.2-1: Procedure for Remote UE switching to indirect Relay
UE</p>
<p>Step 1: Remote UE reports one or multiple candidate Relay UE(s),
after Remote UE measures/discoveries the candidate Relay UE(s).</p>
<p>- Remote UE may filter the appropriate Relay UE(s) meeting higher
layer criteria when reporting, in step 1.</p>
<p>- The reporting may include the Relay UE's ID and SL RSRP
information, where the measurement on PC5 details can be left to WI
phase, in step 1.</p>
<p>Step 2: Decision of switching to a target Relay UE by gNB, and target
(re)configuration is sent to Relay UE optionally (like preparation).</p>
<p>Step 3: RRC Reconfiguration message to Remote UE. Following
information may be included: 1) Identity of the target Relay UE; 2)
Target Uu and PC5 configuration.</p>
<p>Step 4: Remote UE establishes PC5 connection with target Relay UE, if
the connection has not been setup yet.</p>
<p>Step 5: Remote UE feedback the RRCReconfigurationComplete to gNB via
target path, using the target configuration provided in
RRCReconfiguration.</p>
<p>Step 6: The data path switching.</p>
<p>NOTE: Following are further discussed in WI phase, including:<br />
- Whether Step 2 should be after Relay UE connects to the gNB (e.g.
after step 4), if not yet before;<br />
- Whether Step 4 can be before step 2/3.</p>

<p>Remote UE needs to establish its own PDU sessions/DRBs with the
network before user plane data transmission.</p>
<p>PC5-RRC aspects of Rel-16 NR V2X PC5 unicast link establishment
procedures can be reused to setup a secure unicast link between Remote
UE and Relay UE for L2 UE-to-Network relaying before Remote UE
establishes a Uu RRC connection with the network via Relay UE.</p>
<p>For both in-coverage and out-of-coverage cases, when the Remote UE
initiates the first RRC message for its connection establishment with
gNB, the PC5 L2 configuration for the transmission between the Remote UE
and the UE-to-Network Relay UE can be based on the RLC/MAC configuration
defined in specifications.</p>
<p>The establishment of Uu SRB1/SRB2 and DRB of the Remote UE is subject
to legacy Uu configuration procedures for L2 UE-to-Network Relay.</p>
<p>The following high level connection establishment procedure applies
to L2 UE-to-Network Relay:</p>
<p><img src="media/image11.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4.5.5.1-1: Procedure for Remote UE connection
establishment</p>
<p>Step 1. The Remote and Relay UE perform discovery procedure, and
establish PC5-RRC connection using the legacy Rel-16 procedure as a
baseline.</p>
<p>Step 2. The Remote UE sends the first RRC message (i.e.,
<em>RRCSetupRequest</em>) for its connection establishment with gNB via
the Relay UE, using a default L2 configuration on PC5. The gNB responds
with an <em>RRCSetup</em> message to Remote UE. The <em>RRCSetup</em>
delivery to the Remote UE uses the default configuration on PC5. If the
Relay UE had not started in RRC_CONNECTED, it would need to do its own
connection establishment upon reception of a message on the default L2
configuration on PC5. The details for Relay UE to forward the
<em>RRCSetupRequest</em>/<em>RRCSetup</em> message for Remote UE at this
step can be discussed in WI phase.</p>
<p>Step 3. The gNB and Relay UE perform relaying channel setup procedure
over Uu. According to the configuration from gNB, the Relay/Remote UE
establishes an RLC channel for relaying of SRB1 towards the Remote UE
over PC5. This step prepares the relaying channel for SRB1.</p>
<p>Step 4. Remote UE SRB1 message (e.g. an <em>RRCSetupComplete</em>
message) is sent to the gNB via the Relay UE using SRB1 relaying channel
over PC5. Then the Remote UE is RRC connected over Uu.</p>
<p>Step 5. The Remote UE and gNB establish security following legacy
procedure and the security messages are forwarded through the Relay
UE.</p>
<p>Step 6. The gNB sets up additional RLC channels between the gNB and
Relay UE for traffic relaying. According to the configuration from gNB,
the Relay/Remote UE sets up additional RLC channels between the Remote
UE and Relay UE for traffic relaying. The gNB sends an
<em>RRCReconfiguration</em> to the Remote UE via the Relay UE, to set up
the relaying SRB2/DRBs. The Remote UE sends an
<em>RRCReconfigurationComplete</em> to the gNB via the Relay UE as a
response.</p>
<p>Besides the connection establishment procedure, for L2 UE-to-Network
relay:</p>
<p>- The RRC reconfiguration and RRC connection release procedures can
reuse the legacy RRC procedure, with the message content/configuration
design left to WI phase.</p>
<p>- The RRC connection re-establishment and RRC connection resume
procedures can reuse the legacy RRC procedure as baseline, by
considering the above connection establishment procedure of L2
UE-to-Network Relay to handle the relay specific part, with the message
content/configuration design left to WI phase.</p>
<h4 id="paging">4.5.5.2 Paging</h4>
<p>The Option 2 as studied in TR36.746 [7] for FeD2D paging is selected
as the baseline paging relaying solution for L2 UE-to-Network relaying
case (i.e. Relay UE monitors the Remote UE's Paging Occasion(s) in
addition to its own Paging Occasion(s).) . The paging relaying solution
applies to both CN paging and RAN paging via the Option 2.</p>
<h4 id="system-information-delivery">4.5.5.3 System Information
Delivery</h4>
<p>Relay UE can forward the system information to Remote UE via
broadcast, groupcast, or dedicated PC5-RRC signalling. The detailed
mechanisms of broadcast, groupcast and PC5-RRC signalling design and
what system information can be relayed to Remote UEs can be discussed in
WI phase.</p>
<p>On-demand SI request is supported for Remote UE for all RRC states
(Idle/Inactive/Connected state). DedicatedSIBRequest procedure is
re-used for the Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED to request SI via the Relay
UE. For the Remote UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE, how on-demand SI
procedure differs from legacy can be discussed in the WI phase.</p>
<p>A Remote UE (IC or OOC) can request/receive SI via the Relay UE when
PC5-RRC connected to a Relay UE. Reception via Uu for IC Remote UE can
be discussed in the WI phase.</p>
<h4 id="access-control">4.5.5.4 Access control</h4>
<p>For L2 UE-to-Network relay, the Relay UE may provide UAC parameters
to Remote UE. The access control check is performed at Remote UE using
the parameters of the cell it intends to access. The UE-to-Network Relay
UE does not perform access control check for the Remote UE's data.</p>

<p>SA2 captured control plane protocol stacks of L3 UE-to-Network Relay
in solution#6 of TR 23.752 [6]. RAN2 leaves its design to SA2.</p>
<p>For N3IWF solution (i.e. solution#23 captured in TR 23.752 [6]),</p>
<p>- RAN2 understanding is that Remote UE's NAS is sent over PC5/Uu-DRB.
If any AS impact of NAS transport in solution#23 is identified by SA2,
RAN2 can further discuss it in WI phase.</p>
<p>- For the IP header overhead of L3 UE-to-Network Relay with N3IWF,
RAN2 conclude that outer IP header on each hop can be compressed by ROHC
"ESP/IP profile", but the inner IP header can't be compressed by the AS
layer, whose impact could be evaluated by SA2.</p>
<h3 id="qos-1">4.6.2 QoS</h3>
<p>The basic QoS support mechanism for L3 UE-to-Network Relay is
illustrated in Figure 4.6.2-1 from TR 23.752 [6].</p>
<p><img src="media/image14.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 4.6.2-1: basic QoS support mechanism of L3 UE-to-Network Relay
captured in [6]</p>
<p>SA2 captured two solutions for QoS support of L3 UE-to-Network
Relay:</p>
<p>1) Separate Uu QoS parameters and PC5 QoS parameters as in option-2
of solution#25 of TR 23.752 [6].</p>
<p>2) End-to-End QoS support in solution#24 of TR 23.752 [6], where
Relay UE can obtain a mapping between PQI and 5QI from SMF/PCF.</p>
<p>No AS impact is identified for SA2 QoS solution#24 and #25 captured
in TR 23.752 [6], for which legacy PC5-RRC procedure can be reused. RAN2
can consider in WI phase SA2 conclusions on QoS solutions, including
whether it is sufficient to enforce E2E QoS via legacy PC5-RRC
reconfiguration of SLRB and resource allocation.</p>
<p>Remote UE doesn't need to provide information on which QoS flows need
to be relayed to UE-to-Network Relay UE in AS layer. RAN2 don't intend
to study QoS enhancement for L3 UE-to-Network Relay. And RAN2 don't
intend to study the forward compatibility solution for multi-hop
support.</p>
<p>Whether other QoS solutions (e.g., whether gNB can perform PDB split)
are introduced depends on SA2.</p>
<h3 id="security-1">4.6.3 Security</h3>
<p>SA2 captured two solutions for security support of L3 UE-to-Network
Relay:</p>
<p>1) Via legacy Uu security and PC5 security;</p>
<p>2) Via N3IWF in solution #23 of TR 23.752 [6];</p>
<p>Solution#23 of TR 23.752 [6] with N3IWF is feasible to meet
end-to-end security requirements.</p>
<p>Whether the SA2 captured solutions can satisfy the security
requirement depends on SA3.</p>
<h3 id="service-continuity-1">4.6.4 Service Continuity</h3>
<p>For service continuity in L3 UE-to-Network relay, RAN2 makes working
assumption that no AS layer solution will be studied to guarantee the
service continuity, and leave it to the upper layer (e.g. application
layer) solution. This does not exclude studying some enhancements in
mobility scenario for other purposes.</p>

<p>The basic connection setup procedure is illustrated in Figure 4.6.5-1
which is based on Figure 6.6.2-1 in TS 23.752 [6]. Among them, the
following procedures are identified with RAN2 impacts:</p>

<p>- Step 3: the relay (re)selection procedure, which is described in
Clause 4.3.</p>

<h1 id="sidelink-based-ue-to-ue-relay">5 Sidelink-based UE-to-UE
Relay</h1>
<h2 id="scenario-assumption-and-requirement">5.1 Scenario, Assumption
and Requirement</h2>
<p>The UE-to-UE Relay enables the coverage extension of the sidelink
transmissions between two sidelink UEs and power saving. The coverage
scenarios considered in this study are the following:</p>
<p>1) All UEs (Source UE, Relay UE, Destination UE) are in coverage.</p>
<p>2) All UEs (Source UE, Relay UE, Destination UE) are
out-of-coverage.</p>
<p>3) Partial coverage whereby at least one of the UEs involved in
relaying (Source UE, Relay UE, Destination UE) is in-coverage, and at
least one of the UEs involved in relaying is out-of-coverage.</p>
<p>RAN2 will strive for a common solution to the in- and out-of-coverage
cases. For the UE-to-UE Relay, the scenario where UEs can be in coverage
of the different cell is supported.</p>
<p>Figure 5.1-1 shows the scenarios considered for UE-to-UE Relay. In
Figure 5.1-1, coverage implies that the Source/Destination UE and/or
UE-to-UE Relay UE are in coverage and can access the network on Uu.</p>
<p><img src="media/image16.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 5.1-1: Scenarios for UE-to-UE Relay (where the coverage status
is not shown)</p>
<p>NR sidelink is assumed on PC5 between the Remote UE(s) and the
UE-to-UE Relay.</p>
<p>Cross-RAT configuration/control of Source UE, UE-to-UE Relay and
Destination UE is not considered, i.e., eNB/ng-eNB do not
control/configure an NR Source UE, Destination UE or UE-to-UE Relay UE.
For UE-to-UE Relay, this study focuses on unicast data traffic between
the Source UE and the Destination UE.</p>
<p>Configuring/scheduling of a UE (Source UE, Destination UE or UE-to-UE
Relay UE) by the SN to perform NR sidelink communication is out of scope
of this study.</p>
<p>For UE-to-UE Relay, it is assumed that the Remote UE has an active
end-to-end connection via only a single Relay UE at a given time.</p>
<p>Relaying of data between a Source UE and a Destination UE can occur
once a PC5 link is established between the Source UE, UE-to-UE Relay,
and Destination UE.</p>
<p>No restrictions are assumed on the RRC states of any UEs involved in
UE-to-UE Relaying.</p>
<p>The requirement of service continuity is only for UE-to-Network
Relay, but not for UE-to-UE Relay, during mobility in this release.</p>
<h2 id="discovery-1">5.2 Discovery</h2>
<p>Model A and model B discovery model as defined in clause 5.3.1.2 of
TS 23.303 [3] are supported for UE-to-UE Relay, and integrated PC5
unicast link establishment procedure can be supported based on SA2
conclusion. The protocol stack of discovery message is described in
Figure 5.2-1.</p>
<p><img src="media/image4.svg" /></p>
<p>Figure 5.2-1: Protocol Stack of Discovery Message for UE-to-UE
Relay</p>
<p>Relay UE or Remote UE is allowed to transmit discovery message when
triggered by upper layer.</p>
<p>Both Remote UE and Relay UE can rely on pre-configuration unless
relevant radio configuration is provided by network, either via system
information or dedicated signalling.</p>
<p>Resource pool to transmit discovery message can be either shared with
or separated from resource pool for data transmission.</p>
<p>- For both shared resource pool and separated resource pool, a new
LCID is introduced for discovery message i.e. discovery message is
carried by a new SL SRB.</p>
<p>- Within separated resource pool discovery messages are treated
equally with each other during LCP procedure.</p>
<h2 id="relay-re-selection-criteria-and-procedure">5.3 Relay
(re-)selection criteria and procedure</h2>
<p>The baseline solution for relay (re-)selection is as follow:</p>
<p>Radio measurements at PC5 interface are considered as part of relay
(re)selection criteria.</p>
<p>- Remote UE at least uses the radio signal strength measurements of
sidelink discovery messages to evaluate whether PC5 link quality of a
Relay UE satisfies relay selection and reselection criterion.</p>
<p>- When Remote UE is connected to a Relay UE, it may use SL-RSRP
measurements on the sidelink unicast link to evaluate whether PC5 link
quality with the Relay UE satisfies relay reselection criterion.</p>
<p>Further details on the PC5 radio measurements criteria, e.g., in case
of no transmission on the sidelink unicast link can be discussed in WI
phase. How to perform RSRP measurement based on RSRP of discovery
message and/or SL-RSRP if Remote UE has PC5-RRC connection with Relay UE
can be decided in WI phase.</p>
<p>For relay (re-)selection, Remote UE compares the PC5 radio
measurements of a Relay UE with the threshold which is configured by gNB
or preconfigured. Higher layer criteria also need to be considered by
Remote UE for relay (re-)selection, but details can be left to SA2 to
decide. Relay (re-)selection can be triggered by upper layers of Remote
UE.</p>
<p>Relay reselection should be triggered if the NR Sidelink signal
strength of current Sidelink relay is below a (pre)configured threshold.
Also, relay reselection may be triggered if RLF of PC5 link with current
Relay UE is detected by Remote UE.</p>
<p>The above-described baseline for relay (re)selection apply to both L2
and L3 relay solutions. Additional AS layer criteria can be considered
in WI phase for both L2 and L3 UE-to-UE Relay solutions.</p>
<p>For relay (re-)selection, when Remote UE has multiple suitable Relay
UE candidates which meet all AS-layer &amp; higher layer criteria and
Remote UE need to select one Relay UE by itself, it is up to UE
implementation to choose one Relay UE.</p>
<p>As captured in TR 23.752, solution#8 and solution#50 in TR 23.752 are
taken as baseline solution for L2 and L3 UE-to-UE Relay reselection, and
solution#8 and solution#11 in TR 23.752 are taken as baseline solution
for L3 UE-to-UE Relay selection.</p>

are terminated between two Remote UEs, while RLC, MAC and PHY are

<h3 id="layer-2-relay-2">6.1.1 Layer-2 Relay</h3>
<h4 id="conclusions-of-layer-2-relay">6.1.1.0 Conclusions of Layer-2
Relay</h4>
<p>RAN2 has studied L2 UE-to-Network Relay and has concluded that L2
UE-to-Network Relay meets all of the objectives of the NR Sidelink Relay
SID [8]. Specifically, RAN2 has reached the following conclusions:</p>
<h4 id="relay-discovery-and-reselection">6.1.1.1 Relay discovery and
(re)selection</h4>
<p>Discovery was studied for L2 UE-to-Network Relay and the baseline
solution for L2 relay is the same as for L3 relay (as captured in
6.1.2.1). In addition, for L2 UE-to-Network Relay, the Relay UE should
always be connected to a SL capable gNB. Further details of discovery
configuration for the Remote UE can be discussed in the normative
phase.</p>
<p>Relay (Re)selection was studied for L2 UE-to-Network Relay and the
baseline solution for L2 relay is the same as for L3 relay (as captured
in 6.1.2.1). In addition, for RRC_CONNECTED Remote UE connected through
L2 UE-to-Network Relay, gNB decision on relay (re)selection is
considered for the normative phase.</p>
<h4 id="relay-ue-and-remote-ue-authorization">6.1.1.2 Relay UE and
Remote UE authorization</h4>
<p>Both Relay UE and Remote UE separately follow Rel-16 V2X design (TS
23.287), and no RAN2 impact is expected.</p>
<h4 id="qos-management">6.1.1.3 QoS management</h4>
<p>The general QoS handling for L2 UE-to-Network Relay was studied. The
gNB implementation can handle the QoS breakdown over Uu and PC5 for
end-to-end QoS enforcement, and this breakdown can be flexibly tailored
to the AS conditions on sidelink and Uu. Details of handling in case PC5
RLC channels with different E2E QoS are mapped to the same Uu RLC
channel can be discussed in the normative phase. The end-to-end QoS
enforcement can be supported. In case of OOC, Remote UE operates using
the configuration provided in SIB or dedicated RRC signaling with
overall better QoS performance than using pre-configuration. QoS can be
enforced for each bearer as the gNB can decide whether an E2E bearer is
admitted or not depending on the current congestion.</p>
<h4 id="service-continuity-2">6.1.1.4 Service continuity</h4>
<p>L2 UE-to-Network Relay uses RAN2 aspects of Rel-15 NR handover
procedure as a baseline. The AS layer service continuity (i.e. lossless
and in-sequence delivery of PDCP PDU with similar performance like
legacy HO) can be guaranteed during path switch in L2 UE-to-Network
Relay by involving also Relay UEs in the path switch procedure.</p>
<h4 id="security-4">6.1.1.5 Security</h4>
<p>In case of L2 UE-to-Network Relay, at AS layer, the security
(confidentiality and integrity protection) is enforced end to end by
legacy PDCP layer between the endpoints at the Remote UE and the
gNB.</p>
<h4 id="protocol-stack-design">6.1.1.6 Protocol stack design</h4>
<p>The protocol stack and Uu adaptation layer function were studied for
L2 UE-to-Network Relay. Whether the adaptation layer is also supported
at the PC5 interface between Remote UE and Relay UE can be discussed in
the normative phase. In L2 UE-to-Network Relay architecture, the Remote
UE is visible to the gNB, and the Remote UE has its own PDU sessions. It
supports the gNB configured/controlled bearer mapping at the Relay UE
between multiple E2E bearers of a Remote UE and/or different Remote UEs
to one Uu RLC channel.</p>
<h4 id="cp-procedures">6.1.1.7 CP procedures</h4>
<p>Both connection establishment procedure and path switching procedures
were captured for L2 UE-to-Network Relay. The establishment of Uu
SRB1/SRB2 and DRB of the Remote UE is subject to legacy Uu configuration
procedures. It supports the Remote UE's RRC connection management, which
can provide dedicated RRC configuration to Remote UE, reduce the
interruption/avoid data loss due to RLF recovery, and speed up RRC
connection and data resume, etc. Further details of the steps for path
switch procedure (e.g. measurements, message content) and potential
differences on the Uu interface for inter-gNB cases may be discussed in
the normative phase.</p>
<p>The Option 2 as studied in TR36.746 for FeD2D paging is selected as
the baseline paging relaying solution for L2 UE-to-Network Relay. By
supporting paging, for Remote UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE, the DL data
reachability can be supported during Remote UE's mobility.</p>
<p>The system information (i.e. SI) request from Remote UE and
forwarding mechanism from Relay UE to Remote UE was studied for L2
UE-to-Network Relay. Specifically, the Relay UE can forward system
information to the Remote UE via broadcast, groupcast or unicast.
On-demand SI request is supported for all RRC states of the Remote UE.
The detailed mechanism for such SI request and forwarding and the exact
system information that can be relayed to Remote UEs can be discussed at
normative phase. It supports the SI delivery in case Remote UE is OOC,
which supports Remote UE using SIB provided configuration.</p>
<p>For L2 UE-to- Network relay, the Relay UE may provide UAC parameters
to Remote UE for performing Remote UE access control and RAN overload
control. The access control check is performed at Remote UE using the
parameters of the cell it intends to access. Remote UE access control
can take SL congestion into account as the gNB is aware of the
congestion status between Remote UE and Relay UE, using legacy CBR
measurements.</p>
<h3 id="layer-3-relay-2">6.1.2 Layer-3 Relay</h3>
<h4 id="conclusions-of-layer-3-relay">6.1.2.0 Conclusions of Layer-3
Relay</h4>
<p>RAN2 has studied L3 UE-to-Network Relay and has concluded that L3

<h4 id="relay-discovery-and-reselection-1">6.1.2.1 Relay discovery and
(re)selection</h4>
<p>RAN2 concluded that both the model A and model B are to be supported,

<h4 id="relay-and-remote-ue-authorization">6.1.2.2 Relay and Remote UE
authorization</h4>
<p>RAN2 confirmed the solution is up to SA2 and SA3 with no RAN2 impact
foreseen.</p>
<h4 id="qos-management-1">6.1.2.3 QoS management</h4>
<p>This is subject to upper layer solutions defined by SA2 in TR 23.752
[6], clause 8.3. RAN2 can consider in WI phase the SA2 conclusions on
QoS solutions, including whether it is sufficient to enforce E2E QoS via
legacy PC5-RRC reconfiguration of SLRB and resource allocation.</p>
<h4 id="service-continuity-3">6.1.2.4 Service continuity</h4>
<p>No AS layer solution is studied in RAN2 to guarantee service
continuity, and this is left to the upper layer solutions defined by SA2
in TR 23.752 [6].</p>
<h4 id="security-5">6.1.2.5 Security</h4>
<p>Solution#23 of TR 23.752 [6] with N3IWF is assumed to be feasible to
meet end-to-end security requirements from RAN2 perspective.</p>
<h4 id="protocol-stack-design-1">6.1.2.6 Protocol stack design</h4>
<p>RAN2 concluded the CP and UP protocol stacks of L3 UE-to-Network
Relay are up to SA2 and these are illustrated in TR 23.752 [6].</p>
<h4 id="cp-procedures-1">6.1.2.7 CP procedures</h4>
<p>For CP procedures, PC5-RRC aspects of Rel-16 NR V2X PC5 unicast link
establishment procedures can be reused to setup a secure PC5 unicast
link. Further AS impacts (if any) can be discussed in WI phase. Whether
new PC5-S signalling is also introduced depends on SA2. For path switch
procedure, there is no AS solution discussed and concluded in RAN2 to
perform path switch procedure from indirect link to direct link in case
there is data transmission between Remote UE and gNB via a Relay UE.</p>
<h2 id="evaluation-and-conclusion-of-ue-to-ue-relay">6.2 Evaluation and
Conclusion of UE-to-UE Relay</h2>
<h3 id="layer-2-relay-3">6.2.1 Layer-2 Relay</h3>
<h4 id="conclusions-of-layer-2-relay-1">6.2.1.0 Conclusions of Layer-2
Relay</h4>
<p>RAN2 has studied L2 UE-to-UE Relay and has concluded that L2 UE-to-UE
Relay meets all of the objectives of the NR Sidelink Relay SID [8].
Specifically, RAN2 has reached the following conclusions:</p>
<h4 id="relay-discovery-and-reselection-2">6.2.1.1 Relay discovery and
(re)selection</h4>
<p>Discovery was studied for L2 UE-to-UE Relay and the baseline solution
for L2 relay is the same as that of L3 relay.</p>
<p>Relay (Re)selection was studied for L2 UE-to-UE Relay and the
baseline solution for L2 relay is the same as that of L3 relay.</p>
<h4 id="relay-and-remote-ue-authorization-1">6.2.1.2 Relay and Remote UE
authorization</h4>
<p>Both Relay UE and Remote UE separately follow Rel-16 V2X design (TS
23.287), and no RAN2 impact is expected.</p>
<h4 id="qos-management-2">6.2.1.3 QoS management</h4>
<p>The design of QoS support for L2 UE-to-UE Relay are in the scope of
SA2. No RAN2 impact of the solution captured in SA2 is identified thus
far.</p>
<h4 id="security-6">6.2.1.4 Security</h4>
<p>In case of L2 UE-to-UE Relay, the security is established at PDCP
layer in an end to end manner between source Remote UE and destination
Remote UE. The end-to-end security can be supported.</p>
<h4 id="protocol-stack-design-2">6.2.1.5 Protocol stack design</h4>
<p>The protocol stack and PC5 adaptation layer function (both first hop
PC5 and second hop PC5) were studied for L2 UE-to-UE Relay. The usage of
PC5 adaptation layer header(s) enables the AS layer routing/forwarding
via Relay UE for end-to-end UE-to-UE traffic.</p>
<h4 id="cp-procedures-2">6.2.1.6 CP procedures</h4>
<p>The connection establishment procedure was studied for L2 UE-to-UE
Relay. RAN2 consider the SA2 solution in TR 23.752 as baseline. Further
RAN2 impacts can be discussed in WI phase, if any.</p>
<h3 id="layer-3-relay-3">6.2.2 Layer-3 Relay</h3>
<h4 id="conclusions-of-layer-3-relay-1">6.2.2.0 Conclusions of Layer-3
Relay</h4>
<p>RAN2 has studied L3 UE-to-UE Relay and has concluded that L3 UE-to-UE
Relay meets all the objective of the NR Sidelink Relay SID [8].
Specifically, RAN2 has reached the following conclusions:</p>
<h4 id="relay-discovery-and-reselection-3">6.2.2.1 Relay discovery and
(re)selection</h4>
<p>RAN2 concluded that both the model A and model B are to be supported,
and similar AS criteria of LTE relay will be reused as baseline. The
details are left to WI.</p>
<h4 id="relay-ue-and-remote-ue-authorization-1">6.2.2.2 Relay UE and
Remote UE authorization</h4>
<p>RAN2 confirmed the solution is up to SA2 and SA3 with no RAN2 impact
foreseen.</p>
<h4 id="qos-management-3">6.2.2.3 QoS management</h4>
<p>This is subject to upper layer solutions defined by SA2 in TR 23.752
[6], clause 8.4.</p>
<h4 id="security-7">6.2.2.4 Security</h4>
<p>RAN2 concluded the solution is up to SA2 and SA3.</p>
<h4 id="protocol-stack-design-3">6.2.2.5 Protocol stack design</h4>
<p>RAN2 concluded the CP and UP protocol stacks of L3 UE-to-UE Relay are
up to SA2 and these are illustrated in TR 23.752 [6].</p>
<h4 id="cp-procedures-3">6.2.2.6 CP procedures</h4>
<p>RAN2 concluded the design is left to SA2.</p>
<h2 id="feasibility-and-recommendation">6.3 Feasibility and
Recommendation</h2>
<p>RAN2 has studied direct discovery procedure, UE-to-Network Relay, and
UE-to-UE Relay solutions.</p>
<p>Mechanisms for L2 relay and L3 relay have been studied and identified
by RAN2, striving for minimum specification impact. The standards impact
of L2 relay is principally in RAN and the standards impact of L3 relay
is principally in SA. In this study, both L2 based Relay architecture
and L3 based Relay architecture have been found feasible.</p>
<p>RAN2 recommends both L2 and L3 UE-to-Network and UE-to-UE Relay can
proceed to normative work (The final decision depends on both SA and RAN
TSGs#91e outcome).</p>
