1 Scope</h1>
<p>The present document captures the findings of the study item, "Study
on scenarios and requirements of in-coverage, partial coverage, and
out-of-coverage positioning use cases" [2]. The purpose of this TR is to
facilitate future 3GPP work by identifying the requirements and
deployment/operation scenarios for V2X and public safety use cases. In
particular, this study considers positioning for the UEs in in-coverage,
partial coverage, and out-of-coverage as per the network coverage
definition in the current specifications.</p>
<p>This document is a 'living' document, i.e. it is permanently updated
and presented to TSG-RAN meetings until it is approved.</p>

<h1 id="positioning-use-cases-and-requirements">4 Positioning use cases
and requirements</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">4.1 Introduction</h2>
<p>This clause summarizes the positioning use cases and requirements
defined for V2X and public safety in 3GPP specifications and input from
other organizations. Sources used in this summary are provided in Annex
A for information.</p>
<h2 id="v2x">4.2 V2X</h2>
<p>In 3GPP specifications, V2X positioning requirements can be found in
TS 22.261 [3] and TS 22.186 [4]. TS 22.261 [3] specifies the high
accuracy positioning requirements for the 5G system and these
requirements are summarized in its Clause 7.3.2.2 with a note that these
requirements include V2X. Seven different positioning service levels are
defined in Table 7.3.2.2-1 [3] in terms of the horizontal and vertical
accuracy, positioning service availability, and positioning service
latency. TS 22.186 [4] specifies the relative lateral positioning
requirement for general V2X use cases and the relative longitudinal
positioning requirement for the platooning use case in its Clause 5.1
and 5.2.</p>
<p>5GAA provides positioning requirements for 58 V2X services that were
summarized into three groups [5]; the first group with tens of meters
accuracy, the second with lane level accuracy, and the third with
sub-meter level accuracy. The positioning requirements can be on the
3D/2D coordinates (absolute position) or on the distance and/or angle
(relative position) to a reference point, e.g. another UE.</p>
<p>SAE AA TC informs that it is necessary to have a 3GPP positioning
technology which supports advanced V2X applications working even in
various out-of-coverage scenarios [6].</p>
<p>It is observed that the positioning requirements in V2X depend on the
service the UE operates. Also, the requirements are applicable to
relative and absolute positioning depending on the use case or the
positioning service level. In terms of the horizontal or
lateral/longitudinal accuracy, the requirements for the absolute
position or relative position can be categorised into three sets as
follows by incorporating the requirements from the sources mentioned
above:</p>
<p>- Set 1: 10 – 50 m with 68 – 95 % confidence level. This includes
Group 1 in [5] and Service level 1 in [3].</p>
<p>- Set 2: 1 – 3 m with 95 – 99 % confidence level. This includes Group
2 in [5], Service level 2, 3, 4 in [3].</p>
<p>- Set 3: 0.1 – 0.5 m with 95 – 99 % confidence level. This includes
Group 3 in [5], Service level 5, 6, 7 in [3], the requirements in
[4].</p>
<p>It is noted that all the three sets are applicable for absolute
positioning and relative positioning.</p>
<p>Requirements for other performance metrics are also defined in a
range depending on the positioning service level in TS 22.261 [3]; 2 – 3
m (absolute) or 0.2 m (relative) vertical accuracy, 95 – 99.9%
positioning service availability, 10 ms – 1 s positioning service
latency.</p>
<p>Positioning service should be provided in indoor, outdoor, tunnel
areas. The UE velocity up to 250 km/h needs to be supported for outdoor
and tunnel areas. As long as the UE operates a V2X use case having the
corresponding positioning requirements, the requirements should be
fulfilled when the UE is inside the network coverage as well as when it
is outside the network coverage. The requirements should be also
fulfilled when the GNSS-based positioning is not available or not
accurate enough.</p>
<h2 id="public-safety">4.3 Public safety</h2>
<p>Public safety positioning requirements are defined in TS 22.261 [3]
and TS 22.280 [7]. TS 22.261 [3] provides numerical positioning
requirements for the "1st responders" use case in Table B.1-1 in TS
22.261 [3]; 1 m horizontal accuracy, 2 m (absolute) or 0.3 m (relative)
vertical accuracy, 95 – 98 % positioning service availability. TS 22.280
[7] specifies some qualitative positioning requirements in its Clause
5.11, 6.12, and 7.8. These requirements are applicable to both relative
and absolute positioning.</p>
<p>Positioning service should be provided both in indoor and outdoor
areas. As long as the UE operates a public safety use case having the
corresponding positioning requirements, the requirements should be
fulfilled when the UE is inside the network coverage as well as when it
is outside the network coverage. The requirements should be also
fulfilled when the GNSS-based positioning is not available or not
accurate enough.</p>
<h1 id="potential-deployment-and-operation-scenarios">5 Potential
deployment and operation scenarios</h1>
<h2 id="network-coverage">5.1 Network coverage</h2>
<p>Three network coverage scenarios can be considered when at least two
UEs are involved in positioning for V2X and public safety use cases.
Taking the case of two UEs as an example, in-coverage scenario refers to
the case where both UEs are inside the network. Partial coverage means
that one UE remains inside the network coverage but the other UE is
outside the network coverage. Out-of-coverage scenario refers to the
case where both UEs are outside the network coverage. A UE may transit
between in-coverage, partial coverage and out-of-coverage scenarios.</p>
<p>There are V2X and public safety use cases that require positioning
when there is no network and no GNSS coverage.</p>
<p>Figures 5.1-1, 5.1-2, and 5.1-3 illustrate the in-coverage, partial

<h2 id="radio-link">5.2 Radio link</h2>
<p>Uu interface (uplink and downlink), PC5 interface (sidelink), and
their combinations can be considered as the radio link for
positioning.</p>
<p>Uu interface is available for UEs under in-coverage scenario, and
also for UEs under network coverage in partial coverage scenario, while
PC5 interface is available for UEs under in-coverage, partial coverage,
out-of-coverage scenarios.</p>
<p>A positioning operation can be called a Uu-based solution if it uses
only measurements on Uu interface (i.e., measurements on uplink and/or
downlink). An operation can be called a PC5-based solution if it uses
only measurements on PC5 interface (i.e., measurements on sidelink). An
operation can be called a hybrid solution if it uses measurements on
both Uu and PC5 interfaces. In addition to these RAT-dependent
solutions, RAT-independent solutions (e.g., GNSS, sensors, etc.) can be
used, where various technologies can complement each other, where it is
available and applicable.</p>
<p>The necessary information for positioning and the measurements for
positioning can be sent via Uu and/or PC5 interface.</p>
<h2 id="position-calculation-entity">5.3 Position calculation
entity</h2>
<p>Positioning solutions can be categorized by the entity performing the
positioning estimation. Network-based positioning refers to the
solutions where UE position is calculated by a network node. For this
network-based positioning, the UE may report necessary information to
the network for the calculation. UE-based positioning refers to the
solution where UE position is calculated by a UE.</p>
<p>The type of the position calculation entity does not limit which
interface(s) can be used for the radio link(s) in clause 5.2.</p>
<h2 id="ue-types">5.4 UE types</h2>
<p>For V2X use cases, a UE involved in positioning can be installed in a
vehicle, a road side unit, or a device of a vulnerable road user.</p>
<p>A UE in a vehicle or a road side unit can be equipped with a
distributed antenna system where multiple antenna panels of a UE are
installed in different locations. A relevant antenna model for
evaluation can be found in [9].</p>
<p>For public safety use cases, a relevant antenna model for evaluation
can be found in [10].</p>
<p>Different UE types may have different power supply limitations, for
example, a UE used by a vulnerable road user may have limited battery
capacity compared to other types of UE, e.g., a UE installed in a
vehicle or a road side unit.</p>
<h2 id="spectrum">5.5 Spectrum</h2>
<p>For V2X use case, the ITS-dedicated spectrum can be considered for
PC5 interface, and the spectrum licensed to mobile network operators
(including FR2) and the unlicensed spectrum can be considered for both
Uu and PC5 interfaces. Note that there is no mechanism corresponding to
regulatory requirements to use unlicensed spectrum in Rel-17 NR
sidelink.</p>
<p>For public safety use case, the spectrum licensed to mobile network
operators (including FR2) can be considered for both Uu and PC5
interfaces.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">6 Conclusions</h1>
<p>This technical report summarizes the positioning use cases and
requirements for V2X and public safety use cases. The V2X and PS
requirements in this TR are applicable to absolute and relative
positioning. The positioning requirements in V2X depend on the service
the UE operates, and this TR categorized the requirements into three
sets as summarized in Clause 4.</p>
<p>The main aspects of potential deployment and operation scenarios are
provided in Clause 5 including:</p>
<p>- Network coverage:</p>
<p>- In-coverage, partial coverage, out of network coverage
scenarios</p>
<p>- When the UE operates a use case having the corresponding
positioning requirements, the requirements should be fulfilled when the
UE is inside the network coverage as well as when it is outside the
network coverage.</p>
<p>- Radio link:</p>
<p>- Measurements on Uu interface (downlink/uplink), PC5 interface
(sidelink) and their combinations for UE positioning</p>
<p>- Use of RAT-dependent and RAT-independent solutions</p>
<p>- Position calculation entity:</p>
<p>- Network-based and UE-based positioning solutions</p>
<p>- UE types:</p>
<p>- V2X: installed in a vehicle, a road-side unit or a device used by a
vulnerable road user, where different UE types may have different UE
antenna configurations and power supply limitations</p>
<p>- Spectrum:</p>
<p>- V2X: licensed, unlicensed spectrum for both Uu and PC5
air-interfaces and ITS for PC5 air-interface. NOTE: There is no
mechanism corresponding to regulatory requirements to use unlicensed
spectrum in Rel-17 NR sidelink.</p>
<p>- Public safety: licensed spectrum for both Uu and PC5
air-interfaces.</p>
