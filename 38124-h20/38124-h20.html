<h1 id="scope"><br />
1 Scope</h1>
<p>The present document establishes the essential EMC requirements for
"3<sup>rd</sup> generation" digital cellular mobile terminal equipment
and ancillary accessories in combination with a 3GPP NR user equipment
(UE).</p>
<p>The equipment conforming to the requirements laid out in the present
document and used in its intended electromagnetic environment in
accordance with the manufacturer's instructions</p>
<p>- shall not generate electromagnetic disturbances at a level which
may interfere with the intended operation of other equipment;</p>
<p>- has an adequate level of intrinsic immunity to electromagnetic
disturbances to operate as intended;</p>
<p>The present document specifies the applicable EMC tests, methods of
measurement, frequency ranges, applicable limits and minimum performance
criteria for all types of NR UE(s) and their accessories. NR base
station equipment operating within network infrastructure is outside the
scope of the present document. However, the present document does cover
mobile and portable equipment that is intended to be operated in a fixed
location while connected to the AC mains. NR base station equipment
operating within network infrastructure is covered by the technical
specification TS 38.113 [2].</p>
<p>Requirements for the radiated emission from the enclosure port of
integral antenna equipment and ancillaries are included in the present
document. Technical specifications for conducted emissions from the
antenna connector are found in the 3GPP specifications for the radio
interface of NR UE, e.g. TS 38.101-1 [3], for the effective use of the
radio spectrum.</p>
<p>Requirements for the radiated emissions from the enclosure port and
ancillaries cover the following case:</p>
<p>- UE equipment supporting operations in a frequency range for which
antenna connectors are available (i.e. for operations in FR1 as defined
in e.g. TS 38.101-1 [3] for the radio interface).</p>
<p>The immunity requirements are selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus in residential, commercial, light industrial
and vehicular environments. The levels however, do not cover extreme
cases, which may occur in any location but with low probability of
occurrence.</p>
<p>Compliance of radio equipment to the requirements of the present
document does not signify compliance to any requirement related to the
use of the equipment (i.e. licensing requirements).</p>
<p>Compliance to the requirements of the present document does not
signify compliance to any safety requirement. However, any temporary or
permanent unsafe condition caused by EMC is considered as
non-compliance.</p>
<h1 id="references">2 References</h1>

in this text, constitute provisions of the present document.</p>
<p>- References are either specific (identified by date of publication,
edition number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.</p>
<p>- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.</p>

case of a reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a
non-specific reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that

<h2 id="definitions">3.1 Definitions</h2>
<p>For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions
given in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in
the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].</p>
<p><strong>Ancillary equipment:</strong> Equipment (apparatus), used in
connection with a user equipment (UE) is considered as an ancillary
equipment (apparatus) if:</p>
<p>- the equipment is intended for use in conjunction with a UE to
provide additional operational and/or control features to the UE, (e.g.
to extend control to another position or location); and</p>
<p>- the equipment cannot be used on a stand-alone basis to provide user
functions independently of a UE; and</p>
<p>- the UE to which it is connected, is capable of providing some
intended operation such as transmitting and/or receiving without the
ancillary equipment (i.e. it is not a sub‑unit of the main equipment
essential to the main equipment basic functions).</p>
<p><strong>Channel bandwidth:</strong> The RF bandwidth supporting a
single NR RF carrier with the transmission bandwidth configured in the
uplink or downlink of a cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz
and is used as a reference for transmitter and receiver RF
requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Enclosure port:</strong> Physical boundary of the apparatus
through which electromagnetic fields may radiate or impinge. In the case
of integral antenna equipment, this port is inseparable from the antenna
port.</p>
<p><strong>Idle mode:</strong> state of User Equipment (UE) when
switched ON but with no Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection.</p>
<p><strong>Integral antenna:</strong> Antenna designed to be connected
directly to the equipment with or without the use of an external
connector and considered to be part of the equipment. An integral
antenna may be fitted internally or externally to the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Necessary bandwidth:</strong> For a given class of emission,
the width of the frequency band which is just sufficient to ensure the
transmission of information at the rate and with the quality required
under specified conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Out of band emissions:</strong> Emission on a frequency or
frequencies immediately outside the necessary bandwidth, which results
from, the modulation process, but excluding spurious emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Spurious emission:</strong> Emission on a frequency, or
frequencies, which are outside the necessary bandwidth and the level of
which may be reduced without affecting the corresponding transmission of
information. Spurious emissions include harmonic emissions, parasitic
emissions, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products
but exclude out‑of‑band emissions.</p>
<p><strong>Traffic mode:</strong> state of User Equipment (UE) when
switched ON and with Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection
established.</p>
<p><strong>Transient phenomena:</strong> Pertaining to or designating a
phenomenon or a quantity which varies between two consecutive steady
states during a time interval short compared with the time-scale of
interest (IEC 60050-161 [19])</p>
<p><strong>User equipment:</strong> is a "Mobile Station" (MS) which is
an entity capable of accessing a set of NR services via one or more
radio interfaces. This entity may be stationary or in motion within the
NR service area while accessing the NR services, and may simultaneously
serve one or more users.</p>

<h2 id="general">4.1 General</h2>
<p>The equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions according
to the relevant product and basic standards. If these conditions are not
specified then the manufacturers declared range of humidity, temperature
and supply voltage shall be used. The test conditions shall be recorded
in the test report.</p>
<p>Whenever the Equipment under test (EUT) is provided with a detachable
antenna, the EUT shall be tested with the antenna fitted in a manner
typical of normal intended use, unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p>Where the equipment incorporates an external 50 Ω RF antenna
connector that is normally connected via a coaxial cable, then the
wanted signal to establish a communication link also uses a coaxial
cable.</p>
<p>Where the equipment has an external 50 Ω RF antenna connector that is
not normally connected via a coaxial cable or where the equipment has no
external 50 Ω RF connector (i.e., integral antenna equipment), then the
wanted signal, to establish a communication link, shall be delivered
from the equipment to an antenna located within the test
environment.</p>
<p>Requirements throughout the RF specifications are in many cases
defined separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency
ranges in which a UE equipment (NR) can operate according to this
version of the specification are identified as described in table 4.1-1.
The test conditions may be different for operations in FR1 and FR2.</p>

<h2 id="arrangements-for-establishing-a-communication-link">4.2
Arrangements for establishing a communication link</h2>
<p>For transmitters with an integral antenna, the wanted RF output
signal to establish a communication link shall be delivered from the EUT
to an antenna located within the test environment. This antenna shall be
connected to the external measuring equipment by a coaxial cable.</p>
<p>For transmitters with an antenna connector, the wanted RF output
signal to establish a communication link shall be delivered from the
antenna connector to the external measuring equipment by a shielded
transmission line, such as a coaxial cable. Adequate measures shall be
taken to minimize the effect of unwanted common mode currents on the
external conductor of the transmission line at the point of entry to the
transmitter.</p>
<p>The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by
setting the NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number to an appropriate
number.</p>
<p>For UE equipment only support operations in FR1 a communication link
shall be set up with a suitable base station simulator (hereafter called
"the test system"). The test system shall be located outside of the test
environment.</p>
<p>When the EUT is required to be in the traffic mode, a call is set up
according to the generic call set-up procedure and the following
conditions shall be met:</p>
<p>- Set and send continuously positive TPC commands to the UE;</p>
<p>- The DTX shall be disabled;</p>
<p>- Uplink power control shall be enabled;</p>
<p>- transmitting and/or receiving (UL/DL) bit rate for reference test
channel shall be the reference measurement channel as specified in annex
A in TS 38.101-1 [3] with parameters specified in table 7.3.2-1 and
table 7.3.2-2 in TS 38.101-1 [3];</p>
<p>- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the
unwanted signal on the measuring equipment;</p>
<p>- For immunity testing, the wanted input signal level shall be set to
40 dB above the reference sensitivity level to provide a stable
communication link. The reference sensitivity level is defined
in TS 38.101-1 [3];</p>
<p>- For emission testing, the wanted input signal level shall be no
more than 15 dB above the reference sensitivity level, such that the
performance of the measuring receiver is not limited by strong signal
effects.</p>
<p>See TS 38.508-1 [21] and TS 38.509 [22] for details regarding generic
call set-up procedure and throughput test loop scenarios.</p>
<p>When the EUT is required to be in the idle mode the following
conditions shall be met:</p>
<p>- UE shall be camped on a cell</p>
<p>- UE shall perform Location Registration (LR) before the test, but
not during the test;</p>
<p>- UE´s neighbour cell list shall be empty;</p>
<p>- Paging repetition period and DRX cycle shall be set to minimum
(shortest possible time interval).</p>
<p>For immunity tests, clause 4.3 applies.</p>
<h2 id="narrow-band-responses-on-receivers">4.3 Narrow band responses on
receivers</h2>
<p>Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the
test at discrete frequencies, which are narrow band responses (spurious
responses), are identified by the following method:</p>
<p>- If during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes
outside the specified tolerances, it is necessary to establish whether
the deviation is due to an unwanted effect on the receiver of the UE or
on the test system (narrow band response) or to a wide band (EMC)
phenomenon. Therefore, the test shall be repeated with the unwanted
signal frequency increased or decreased by BW<sub>Channel</sub> MHz,
where BW<sub>Channel</sub> is the channel bandwidth as defined in TS
38.101-1 [3];</p>
<p>- If the deviation does not disappear, the procedure is repeated the
unwanted signal frequency increased or decreased by 2 x
BW<sub>Channel</sub> MHz, where BW<sub>Channel</sub> is the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.101-1 [3];</p>
<p>- If the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or
decreased frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and
therefore an EMC problem and the equipment fails the test.</p>
<p>Narrow band responses are disregarded.</p>
<p>The procedure above does not apply to conducted immunity tests in the
frequency range 150 kHz to 80 MHz.</p>
<h2 id="receiver-exclusion-band">4.4 Receiver exclusion band</h2>
<p>The receiver exclusion band for terminals extends from the lower
frequency of the allocated receiver band minus 85 MHz to the upper
frequency of the allocated receiver band plus 85 MHz. The <em>receiver
exclusion band</em> for UE is the frequency range over which no tests of
radiated immunity of a receiver are made. The exclusions bands are as
set out below:</p>
<p>F<sub>DL,low</sub> – 85 &lt; f &lt; F<sub>DL,high</sub> + 85
(MHz)</p>
<p>Where values of F<sub>DL,low</sub> and F<sub>DL,high</sub> are
defined for each operating band in TS 38.101-1 [3], clause 5.2.</p>

that permits the establishment of a communication link. The assessment
of equipment performance shall be based on data transfer according to
the criteria in clause 6.</p>
<h2
id="equipment-which-can-only-provide-a-discontinuous-communication-link-packet-datatransmission">5.3
Equipment which can only provide a discontinuous communication link
(packet data/transmission)</h2>
<p>If the equipment does not permit or allow for a communications link
to be established and maintained during the EMC tests (as in clause
5.2), the manufacturer shall define the performance assessment. The
manufacturer shall provide the method of observing the degradation of
performance of the equipment.</p>
<h2 id="equipment-which-does-not-provide-a-communication-link">5.4

<p>If the equipment is of a specialised nature which does not permit a
communication link to be established, the manufacturer shall define the
method of test to determine the acceptable level of performance or
degradation of performance during and/or after the test. The
manufacturer shall provide the method of observing the degradation of
performance of the equipment.</p>
<p>The performance assessment carried out shall be simple, but at the
same time give adequate proof that the primary functions of the
equipment are operational.</p>

of measurement and limits for EMC emissions</h1>
<h2 id="test-configurations">8.1 Test configurations</h2>
<p>This clause defines the configurations for emission tests as
follows:</p>
<p>- the equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions;</p>
<p>- the test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;</p>
<p>- if the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to
ancillary equipment, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment
while connected to the minimum configuration of ancillary equipment
necessary to exercise the ports;</p>
<p>- if the equipment has a large number of ports, then a sufficient
number shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to
ensure that all the different types of termination are tested;</p>
<p>- the test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall
be recorded in the test report;</p>
<p>- ports which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to
an ancillary equipment or to a representative piece of cable correctly
terminated to simulate the input/output characteristics of the ancillary
equipment, Radio Frequency (RF) input/output ports shall be correctly
terminated;</p>
<p>- ports that are not connected to cables during normal operation,
e.g. service connectors, programming connectors; temporary connectors
etc. shall not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC
testing. Where cables have to be connected to these ports, or
interconnecting cables have to be extended in length in order to
exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to ensure that the
evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or extension of
these cables;</p>
<p>- emission tests shall be performed in two modes of operation:</p>
<p>- with a communication link established (traffic mode); and</p>
<p>- without a communication link established (idle mode).</p>
<h2 id="radiated-emission">8.2 Radiated emission</h2>
<h3 id="general-3">8.2.1 General</h3>
<p>This test is applicable to radio communications equipment and
ancillary equipment.</p>
<p>This test shall be performed on the radio equipment and/or a
representative configuration of the ancillary equipment.</p>
<h3 id="definition">8.2.2 Definition</h3>
<p>This test assesses the ability of radio equipment and ancillary
equipment to limit unwanted emissions from the enclosure port.</p>
<p>For UE equipment supporting operations in FR2 (table 4.1-1) with
integral antennas only (no antenna connectors available), the EMC
radiated emissions cannot be distinguished between the intended
emissions nor to any spurious emissions related to these intentional
transmissions:</p>
<p>- This test is applicable to UE equipment without integral antennas,
i.e. FR1.</p>
<p>- For UE equipment with integral antennas only, i.e. FR2, the
radiated emission is covered by radiated spurious emission requirement
in TS 38.101-2 [4].</p>
<h3 id="test-method">8.2.3 Test method</h3>
<p>Whenever possible the site shall be a fully anechoic chamber (FAC)
simulating the free-space conditions. EUT shall be placed on a
non-conducting support. Mean power of any spurious components shall be
detected by the test antenna and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum
analyser).</p>
<p>At each frequency at which a component is detected, the EUT shall be
rotated to obtain maximum response, and the effective radiated power
(e.r.p.) of that component determined by a substitution measurement,
which shall be the reference method. The measurement shall be repeated
with the test antenna in the orthogonal polarization plane.</p>
<p>NOTE: Effective radiated power e.r.p. refers to the radiation of a
half wave tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a
constant difference of 2.15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p.</p>
<p>e.r.p. (dBm) = e.i.r.p. (dBm) − 2.15 , Ref. ITU-R SM. 329 annex 1
[5]</p>
<p>Measurements are made with a tuned dipole antenna or a reference
antenna with a known gain referenced to an isotropic antenna. Unless
otherwise stated, all measurements are done as mean power (RMS).</p>
<h3 id="limits">8.2.4 Limits</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise stated, the radiated spurious emission limits apply
for the frequency ranges that are more than F<sub>OOB</sub> (MHz) in
table 8.2.4-0 from the edge of the channel bandwidth. The radiated
spurious emission limits in table 8.2.4-1 for traffic mode and in table
8.2.4.-2 for idle mode, apply for all transmitter band configurations
(N<sub>RB</sub>) and channel bandwidths.</p>
<p>The references for these requirements are ITU-R SM 329 [5], SM.1539
[18] and TS 38.101-1 [3] for FR1.</p>
<p>The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed
transitions of the limits between the requirements for out of band
emissions and spurious emissions are based on ITU-R SM 329 [5].</p>
<p>These requirements are only applicable for frequencies in the
spurious domain. The limits are specified in table 8.2.4-1 for traffic
mode and in table 8.2.4.-2 for idle mode for UE equipment supporting
operations in FR1 only.</p>
